1.  Introduction

   [RFC3935] declares that the goal of the IETF "is to make the Internet
   work better."

   It goes on to define the Internet as:

      A large, heterogeneous collection of interconnected systems that
      can be used for communication of many different types between any
      interested parties connected to it.  The term includes both the
      "core Internet" (ISP networks) and "edge Internet" (corporate and
      private networks, often connected via firewalls, NAT boxes,
      application layer gateways and similar devices.

   But later, in Section 4.2, goes on to say:

      In attempting to resolve the question of the IETF's scope, perhaps
      the fairest balance is struck by this formulation: "protocols and
      practices for which secure and scalable implementations are
      expected to have wide deployment and interoperation on the
      Internet, or to form part of the infrastructure of the Internet."

   When a new proposal is brought to the IETF, this scope is important
   to keep in mind; if the proposal is specified to certain kinds of
   deployments, but might cause harm in others, it could be
   inappropriate to "have wide deployment and interoperation on the
   Internet" as a whole.

   For example, a datacentre network might want to change how congestion
   control operates (or remove it entirely) inside its confines.  While
   this might be advantageous in a controlled environment, it would be
   disastrous to do so on the open Internet, as it would result in
   congestion collapse [I-D.ietf-tcpm-dctcp].

   Or, a financial institution might need to conform to regulations
   specific to them, and thus need to change how encrypted protocols on
   their network operate to enable efficient monitoring of activity,
   while still adhering to their security requirements.  While this
   might be seen as pragmatic in that environment, using such techniques
   on the open Internet would be widely seen as a step (or many steps)
   backwards in security, as it would sacrifice forward security, and
   furthermore be prone to abuse for attacks such as pervasive
   monitoring [RFC7258].

   In discussing such proposals, there is often a question of whether it
   is appropriate to promote something to Internet Standard, or even
   publish it at all.

   Clearly, every Internet specification need not be deployable on every
   Internet-connected network; likewise, the very possibility of harm
   does not automatically preclude standardisation.  However, when the
   potential consequences and/or likelihood of deployment outside the
   intended environment are too great, such a proposal needs much more
   careful vetting.

   This document explores the properties of such "limited scope"
   proposals and suggests guidelines for evaluating whether they should
   be published.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Scoping Protocols for the Internet

   Engineers often concentrate on the problems immediately in front of
   them, and propose solutions that minimally solve those problems.
   While this is acceptable practice in a limited, known environment,
   this style of engineering often fails when proposing changes to the
   Internet, because it is such a diverse environment.

   In a limited environment, it's not uncommon to be able to make a
   variety of assumptions about deployment architecture, user
   expectations, traffic characteristics, and so on.  On the Internet as
   a whole, this is not true; not only is it diverse, but it is also
   open; we do not know all of the ways in which is is used, deployed,
   or operated.

   Therefore, proposals to change it need to consider what effect they
   will have when deployed generally, not just specifically within the
   scope they were designed for.

2.1.  Defining Limited Scope

   A proposal is said to have "limited scope" if it is designed with
   deployment on a subset of the Internet, or if it is known to only be
   suitable for deployment on a subset of the Internet.

   A subset of the Internet could be a single network, or a single type
   of Internet-connected network.  Generally, it would be considered
   "edge Internet", using [RFC3935] terminology.

   A proposal could be a new protocol, an extension to an existing
   protocol, or a change to an existing protocol.

2.2.  What is "Harmful"?

   "Harm" is not defined in this document; that is something that the
   relevant body (e.g., Working Group) needs to discuss.  The IETF has
   already established a body of guidance for such decisions, including
   (but not limited to) [RFC7754] on filtering, [RFC7258] and [RFC7624]
   on pervasive surveillance, [RFC7288] on host firewalls, and [RFC6973]
   regarding privacy considerations.

2.3.  Can Harmful Deployment Be Avoided?

   A key consideration when evaluating a limited-scope proposal is
   whether harmful deployment can be avoided.  This is most often done
   by considering the incentives for various parties to deploy - or
   avoid deploying - the proposal more widely.

   For example, a proposal to disable congestion control in TCP needs to
   be enabled in the operating system (in most current implementations).
   The operating system vendor has a strong incentive to deliver
   flexible yet safe systems; congestion collapse due to irresponsible
   deployment will lead to less use of that operating system, so the
   vendor will assure that it is deployed responsibly, most likely by
   requiring the administrator of the machine to explicitly configure
   their machine to do so.

   The administrator, in turn, has a strong incentive to make sure that
   all applications on the machine have fair network access, and that
   the machine is no penalised as a bad actor by the network it operates
   within; operating without congestion control on an ISP network, for
   example, will eventually get noticed, and likely result in access
   being terminated.

   These incentives suggest that it is safe for the IETF to define
   limited-deployment modifications to congestion control, because wider
   deployment on the Internet - where it would be harmful - is against
   the interests of the relevant parties.

   A counterexample would be a proposal to weaken encryption to make it
   possible to monitor it in enterprise networks.  While there might be
   a reasonable argument for deploying this in a constrained network,
   the potential harm if it is deployed on the broader Internet is
   considerable; it could be used to enable pervasive monitoring
   [RFC7624], for example.

   It's much less clear whether the appropriate incentives are in place
   to avoid harmful deployment of such a proposal.  Depending on the
   specifics of how it worked, deployment could be compelled, for
   example.

2.4.  Considering the Impact of Standardisation

   When the IETF determines that a limited-scope proposal cannot be
   published due to its potential harm, a few counter-arguments usually
   surface.

   It is sometimes argued that if the IETF withholds standards-track
   status (or publication altogether) the proponents can still have
   their proposal published as an Individual Submission, or by another
   standards organisation.

   This might be true, but it ignores the imprimatur of the IETF
   Standards Track; becoming an IETF standard _does_ have demonstrable
   value, otherwise participants would not have invested significant

   resources into creating them, and indeed the proponents would not
   have brought their proposal to the IETF.

   Likewise, publication as an RFC - even on another track - is
   perceived by many as an implied endorsement by the IETF.

   A similar argument is that by accepting such work into the IETF, we
   can minimise harm and avoid something worse being published
   elsewhere.  Again, this might be true, but if we compromise our
   values (as expressed in existing Internet Standards and Best Current
   Practices) to do so, this is a loss much greater than the area of the
   proposal in question; it establishes a precedent for further erosion
   of them, and dilutes their current expression.  This must be avoided.

   While the bar is lower for other documents (e.g., Informational), it
   is expected that the same considerations will apply for any document
   that is an IETF work product.
