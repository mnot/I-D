1.  Introduction

   The HTTP Vary header field (Section 12.5.5 of [HTTP]) allows an
   origin server to describe what aspects of requests affect the content
   of its responses.  This information is useful in many ways; most
   prominently, downstream caches can use it to select the correct
   stored response for a given request (Section 4.1 of [HTTP-CACHING]).

   However, the information conveyed by Vary is limited.  If the request
   headers enumerated in it are considered as a n-dimensional space with
   each field representing an axis, this response header:

   Vary: Accept-Encoding, Accept-Language, ECT

   indicates that there is a three-dimensional space of potential
   responses that could be sent.  However, nothing more is conveyed; the
   number and nature of the entries on each axis are not available,
   leaving caches and other downstream consumers none the wiser as to
   how broad this space is, or how to navigate it.

   This design makes using Vary difficult.  A cache doesn't have enough
   information available to decide whether one of its stored responses
   is the best to satisfy a given request in all but the most simple
   circumstances.

   For example, if a request indicates that the client prefers responses
   in the French language, but will also accept English, and the cache
   has a stored English response, what is the appropriate action?
   Should it serve the English response, or should it make a request to
   the server for a French response and hope that one might be available
   -- adding significant latency if it is not?

   This specification defines a new type of HTTP header field -- an
   _availability hint_ -- that augments the information on a single axis
   of content negotiation, by describing the selection of responses that
   a server has available along that axis.  So, our example above have
   three availabilty hints added to it:

   Vary: Accept-Encoding, Accept-Language, ECT
   Avail-Encoding: gzip, br
   Avail-Language: fr, en;d
   Avail-ECT: ("slow-2g" "2g" "3g"), ("4g");d

   This says that there are two encodings available -- gzip and brotli
   -- beyond the mandatory "identity" encoding; that both French and
   English are available, but English is the default; and that there are
   two different representations available depending on the Effective
   Connection Type that the client advertises, with "4g" being the
   default.

   Caches and other clients can use this information to determine when a
   request can be satisfied by a stored response, and what other options
   might be available.  Using the example above, we can know that the
   response to a request an ECT of "2g" can also be used for a request
   with "3g".

   Availability hints have some limitations.  While a server's
   preferences along a single axis of negotiation can be conveyed by the
   corresponding availability hint, its relative preferences between
   multiple axes are not.  In the example above, it isn't possible to
   know whether the server prefers that downstream caches and clients
   use the brotli-encoded French version over the gzip-encoded English
   version.

   Likewise, it is't possible to convey "holes" in the dimensional space
   described by Vary.  For example, a gzip-encoded French response may
   not be available from the server.  This specification does not
   attempt to address this shortcoming.

   Availability hints do not specify exactly how caches should behave in
   all circumstances.  Because they operate as an optimisation, they
   often have different behaviours based upon the specific requirements
   of their deployment.  Availability hints are designed to better
   inform their operation, not constrain it.

   Finally, availability hints need to be defined for each axis of
   content negotiation in use, and the recipient (such as a cache) needs
   to understand that availability hint.  If either condition is not
   true, that axis of negotiation will fall back to the behaviour
   specified by Vary.

   Section 2 describes how availability hints are defined.  Section 4
   specifies how availability hints are processed, with respect to the
   Vary header field.  Section 5 defines a number of availability hints
   for existing HTTP content negotiation mechanisms.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Defining Availability Hints

   The specification for an availability hint applies to a single axis
   of HTTP proactive content negotiation; for example, that enabled by
   the Accept-Encoding request header field.

   An availability hint specification needs to convey the following
   information:

   1.  The definition of a response header field that describes the
       available responses along that axis of content negotiation.

   2.  An algorithm or guidelines for using that information to
       determine whether a stored response can be selected for a
       presented request (per Section 4.1 of [HTTP-CACHING]).

   The response header field should be defined as a Structured Field
   [STRUCTURED-FIELDS].

   It is recommended that the selection algorithm operate solely using
   information in the stored responses and presented request, if
   possible.  If the selection algorithm can return multiple available
   responses, they should indicate an order of preference.

   Either the response header field or the algorithm should indicate
   which of the available responses is the default -- i.e., which is
   used if none match.

3.  Publishing Availability Hints

   TBD - advice to sites about how to publish / use availability hints

4.  Calculating Cache Keys with Availability Hints

   When presented with a response that has both a Vary header field and
   one or more availability hints, this specification augments the
   process defined in Section 4.1 of [HTTP-CACHING].

   While the model there is defined in terms of whether the header
   fields from two requests match, availability hints invoke a different
   processing model; the set of stored responses that can be used to
   satisfy a presented request is found by:

   1.  Determine the Vary header field and availability hints present
       for the presented URL.  They SHOULD be obtained from the most
       recently obtained response for that URL, although they MAY be
       obtained from any fresh response for that URL (per Section 4.2 of
       [HTTP-CACHING]).

   2.  For each content negotiation axis in the Vary header field,
       determine which stored responses can be selected by running the
       corresponding selection algorithm, as defined by the availability
       hint.

       1.  If an axis of content negotiation is not recognised or
           implemented by the cache, fall back to selecting available
           responses for that axis using the rules described in
           Section 4.1 of [HTTP-CACHING].

   3.  Return the intersection of the results of (2).

   This specification does not define how to select the most appropriate
   response when more than one is returned, but it is RECOMMENDED that
   client preferences be observed when expressed.

5.  Availability Hint Definitions

   The following subsections define availability hints for a selection
   of existing content negotiation mechanisms.

5.1.  Content Encoding

   The Avail-Encoding response header field is the availability hint for
   content negotiation using the Accept-Encoding request header field
   defined in Section 12.5.3 of [HTTP].  For example:

   Vary: Accept-Encoding
   Avail-Encoding: gzip, br

   Avail-Encoding is a Structured Field, whose value is a List
   (Section 3.1 of [STRUCTURED-FIELDS]) of Tokens (Section 3.3.4 of
   [STRUCTURED-FIELDS]).  Each list item indicates a content-coding that
   is available for the resource.  Additionally, the "identity" encoding
   is always considered to be available, and is the default encoding.

   The selection algorithm for this axis of content negotiation is
   described in Section 12.5.3 of [HTTP].

5.2.  Content Format

   The Avail-Format response header field is the availability hint for
   content negotiation using the Accept request header field defined in
   Section 12.5.1 of [HTTP].  For example:

   Vary: Accept
   Avail-Format: image/png, image/gif;d

   Avail-Format is a Structured Field, whose value is a List
   (Section 3.1 of [STRUCTURED-FIELDS]) of Tokens (Section 3.3.4 of
   [STRUCTURED-FIELDS]).  Each list item indicates a media type ("type/
   subtype") that is available for the resource.

   A single member of the List MAY have the "d" parameter, which
   indicates that member is the default format.

   The selection algorithm for this axis of content negotiation is
   described in Section 12.5.1 of [HTTP].

5.3.  Content Language

   The Avail-Language response header field is the availability hint for
   content negotiation using the Accept-Language request header field
   defined in Section 12.5.4 of [HTTP].  For example:

   Vary: Accept-Language
   Avail-Language: en-uk, en-us;d, fr, de

   Avail-Format is a Structured Field, whose value is a List
   (Section 3.1 of [STRUCTURED-FIELDS]) of Tokens (Section 3.3.4 of
   [STRUCTURED-FIELDS]).  Each list item indicates a language tag that
   is available for the resource.

   A single member of the List MAY have the "d" parameter, which
   indicates that member is the default language.

   The selection algorithm for this axis of content negotiation is
   described in Section 12.5.4 of [HTTP].

5.4.  Cookie

   The Cookie-Indices response header field is the availability hint for
   content negotiation using the Cookie request header field defined in
   [RFC6265].  For example:

   Vary: Cookie
   Cookie-Indices: "id", "sid"

   Cookie-Indices is a Structured Field, whose value is a List
   (Section 3.1 of [STRUCTURED-FIELDS]) of Strings (Section 3.3.3 of
   [STRUCTURED-FIELDS]).  Each list item indicates a cookie name whose
   value is to be considered when selecting responses.

   The selection algorithm for Cookie-Indices, given a set of
   stored_responses a presented_request, and the value of Cookie-
   Indices:

   1.  Let available_responses be an empty set.

   2.  For each stored_response in stored_responses:

       1.  For each cookie_index in Cookie-Indices:

           1.  Let presented_values be a list of the values of the
               cookies with the name cookie_index in presented_request,
               lexicographically sorted.  If no cookie with the name
               cookie_index is present in presented_request, let
               presented_values be an empty list.

           2.  Let stored_values be a list of the values of the cookies
               with the name cookie_index in stored_response,
               lexicographically sorted.  If no cookie with the name
               cookie_index is present in stored_response, let
               stored_values be an empty list.

           3.  If presented_values does not equal stored_values,
               continue to the next stored_response.

       2.  Add stored_response to available_responses.

   3.  Return available_responses.

   Note that this algorithm requires storing the cookies from the
   associated request with each response.
