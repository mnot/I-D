Internet-Drafts
===============

These are Internet-Drafts I've authored or contributed to. All are
works-in-progress.

"Abandoned" contains drafts I'm no longer pursuing; "Published" contains those
that made it into an RFC, in one manner or another.

For status, see:
  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/{draft_name}/


Giving Feedback
---------------

If the draft you want to make a comment upon specifies an e-mail list for
feedback, please use that. Usually, it's in the abstract.

Otherwise, feel free to either contact me via e-mail, or to open an issue 
on github.


Making Contributions
--------------------

If you want to submit a pull request against a draft, be aware that I use
two different toolchains (depending on how old the draft is);

For older drafts, it's straight [xml2rfc](http://xml.resource.org/), and you
can just use 'make' to generate the draft.

Newer drafts use [kramdown-rfc2629](https://github.com/cabo/kramdown-rfc2629),
and you'll need to do a 'make kramdown; make'.

You can tell the difference by looking for 'draft.md'.
