1.  Introduction

   The IETF, while focused on technical matters, is not neutral about
   the purpose of its work in developing the Internet [RFC3935]:

      The IETF community wants the Internet to succeed because we
      believe that the existence of the Internet, and its influence on
      economics, communication, and education, will help us to build a
      better human society.

   and:

      The Internet isn't value-neutral, and neither is the IETF.  We
      want the Internet to be useful for communities that share our
      commitment to openness and fairness.  We embrace technical

      concepts such as decentralized control, edge-user empowerment and
      sharing of resources, because those concepts resonate with the
      core values of the IETF community.  These concepts have little to
      do with the technology that's possible, and much to do with the
      technology that we choose to create.

   However, the IETF is most comfortable making what we believe to be
   purely technical decisions; our process is defined to favor technical
   merit, through our well-known bias towards "rough consensus and
   running code".

   Nevertheless, the running code that results from our process (when
   things work well) inevitably has an impact beyond technical
   considerations, because the underlying decisions afford some uses
   while discouraging others; while we believe we are making purely
   technical decisions, in reality that may not be possible.  Or, in the
   words of Lawrence Lessig [CODELAW]:

      Ours is the age of cyberspace.  It, too, has a regulator... This
      regulator is code -- the software and hardware that make
      cyberspace as it is.  This code, or architecture, sets the terms
      on which life in cyberspace is experienced.  It determines how
      easy it is to protect privacy, or how easy it is to censor speech.
      It determines whether access to information is general or whether
      information is zoned.  It affects who sees what, or what is
      monitored.  In a host of ways that one cannot begin to see unless
      one begins to understand the nature of this code, the code of
      cyberspace regulates.

   This impact has become significant.  As the Internet increasingly
   mediates key functions in societies, it has unavoidably become
   profoundly political; it has helped people overthrow governments and
   revolutionize social orders, control populations and reveal secrets.
   It has created wealth for some individuals and companies, while
   destroying others'.

   All of this raises the question: For whom do we go through the pain
   of gathering rough consensus and writing running code?

   There are a variety of identifiable parties in the larger Internet
   community that standards can provide benefit to, such as (but not
   limited to) end users, network operators, schools, equipment vendors,
   specification authors, specification implementers, content owners,
   governments, non-governmental organisations, social movements,
   employers, and parents.

   Successful specifications will provide some benefit to all of the
   relevant parties, because standards do not represent a zero-sum game.

   However, there are often situations where we need to balance the
   benefits of a decision between two (or more) parties.

   To help clarify such decisions, Section 2 mandates that end users
   have the highest priority.

   Our goal is not to avoid all potential harm to or constraint of end
   users; rather, it's to give guidance in a particular situation - when
   we've identified a conflict between the interests of end users and
   another stakeholder (e.g., a network operator), and need a
   "tiebreaker", we should err on the side of finding a solution that
   doesn't harm end users.

   Note that "harm" is not defined in this document; that is something
   that the relevant body (e.g., Working Group) needs to discuss.  The
   IETF has already established a body of guidance for such decisions,
   including (but not limited to) [RFC7754] on filtering, [RFC7258] and
   [RFC7624] on pervasive surveillance, [RFC7288] on host firewalls, and
   [RFC6973] regarding privacy considerations.

   Over time, additional guidance is likely to be defined.  In the
   absence of specific guidance on a given topic, this document provides
   a general approach to making such decisions.

   Doing so helps the IETF achieve its mission, and also helps to assure
   the long-term health of the Internet.  By prioritising the concerns
   of end users, we assure that it reaches the greatest number of
   people, thereby delivering greater utility by maximising its network
   effect.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  The Internet is for End Users

   When there are unresolvable conflicts between the interests of
   different parties, Internet standards MUST consider the end users of
   the Internet to have priority over every other party.

   While networks need to be managed, employers and equipment vendors
   need to meet business goals, and so on, the IETF's mission is to
   "build a better human society" [RFC3935] and - on the Internet -
   society is composed of end users, along with groups of them forming
   business, governments, clubs, civil society organizations, and other
   institutions that influence it.

Internet-Draft        The Internet is for End Users          August 2017


   By "end users," we mean non-technical users whose activities our
   protocols are designed to support.  Thus, the end user of a protocol
   to manage routers is not a router administrator; it is the people
   using the network that the router operates within.

   This does not mean that the IETF community has any specific insight
   into what is "good for end users"; as always, we will need to
   interact with the greater Internet community and apply our process to
   help us make decisions, deploy our protocols, and ultimately
   determine their success or failure.

   It does means that, because end users are not technical experts, we
   have a responsibility to consider their interests, and will need to
   engage with those who understand how our work will affect end users,
   such as civil society organisations, as well as governments,
   businesses and other groups representing some aspect of end user
   interests.

   When a proposed solution to a problem has a benefit to some other
   party at the identified expense of end users, we will find a
   different solution or find another way to frame the problem.

   There may be cases where genuine technical need requires compromise.
   However, such tradeoffs need to be carefully examined, and avoided
   when there are alternate means of achieving the desired goals.  If
   they cannot be, these choices and reasoning SHOULD be carefully
   documented.

   For example, IPv6 [RFC8200] can be used to assign a client with a
   unique address prefix - even though this provides a way to track end
   user activity and helps identify them - because it is technically
   necessary to provide networking (and despite this, there are
   mechanisms like [RFC4941] to mitigate this effect, for those users
   who desire it).

   Finally, this requirement only comes into force when an explicit
   conflict between the interests of end users and other relevant
   parties is encountered (e.g., by being brought up in the Working
   Group).  It does not imply that a standards effort needs to be
   audited for user impact, or every decision weighed against end user
   interests.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require action by IANA.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not have direct security impact; however, failing
   to prioritise end users might well affect their security negatively
   in the long term.

Appendix B.  Frequently Asked Questions

B.1.  Why do we need this?

   It's not uncommon for proposals to be made in the IETF for a change
   to a protocol - one that's being designed or already deployed - to
   make certain tasks easier, but in a way that causes q concern about
   impact upon end users.

Internet-Draft        The Internet is for End Users          August 2017


   For example, network operators approached the HTTP Working Group in
   2014 with a proposal to allow an "explicitly authenticated proxy" to
   be involved in HTTPS connections, so that operators could interpose
   new services, improve network efficiency and meet regulatory
   mandates.

   After much discussion, the Working Group declined the new work, on
   the grounds that HTTPS was explicitly documented as an end-to-end
   encrypted protocol [RFC7230], and couldn't be changed retroactively.

   Having a policy like this in place would have given the Working Group
   a way to hold a more productive and limited discussion, because it
   would be focused on the question "Does intercepting HTTPS have an
   unacceptable potential for harming end users?"

   Achieving even rough consensus [RFC7282] on that would allow the
   Working Group to conclude discussion more quickly, while still giving
   the proposal a fair hearing.

   That discussion would still necessarily need to encompass the nature
   of the harm, various tradeoffs and possible alternatives, as
   discussed above.  Nevertheless, having _some_ form of guidance
   regarding the overall goals and priorities does help Working Groups
   in this situation.

B.2.  How will this impact my Working Group?

   When someone identifies a potential negative impact upon end users in
   a document or proposal, the Working Group should assess it.  If the
   Working Group does reach consensus (even rough, as per [RFC7282])
   that this is the case, the risk will need to be mitigated, or an
   alternative approach found.

   As explained above, there might be cases where the Working Group
   determines that there is potential for end user impact, but that it
   is the "least worst" option.  Section 2 requires these situations to
   be documented (e.g., in Security Considerations), to help
   contextualise the decision, warn deployers and users of potential
   problems, and encourage further protocol development to mitigate the
   risk.

B.3.  How do Working Groups decide what's in the interest of end users?

   Using the same process of discussion and consensus-gathering as they
   do now, but focused on the issue of what the impact upon users is.

   Doing so might include broadening participation in the working group
   to include new perspectives that are not well-represented, to assure
   diversity and better represent end user concerns.

   In many Working Groups, implementers have a strong voice, since
   implementation is necessary for successful deployment.  When
   assessing end-user impact, however, the desires of implementers might
   conflict with the needs of end users, and so care must be taken to
   avoid assigning too much weight to the availability of
   implementations.

   Finally, as discussed, the IETF has a variety of specific guidance
   regarding privacy, security and other areas that potentially impact
   end users, and it is expected to grow over time.  This document
   provides a more general goal in areas that are not yet covered by
   such guidance; it does not override it.
