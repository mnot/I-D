1.  Introduction

   To allow origin servers and tools that they use to be easily
   configured, this document defines a Gateway Description Format that
   describes the configuration of an HTTP gateway (commonly, a "reverse
   proxy" or content delivery network).  It is intended to be generated
   by gateways and made available out-of-band to origin servers using
   them.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Gateway Description Format

   The Gateway Description Format is a JSON [JSON] document.  The root
   object SHOULD contain members with the following names and values:

   *  "generated": a string containing the date that the description was
      generated, in the Internet Date/Time Format described in Section 5
      of [RFC3339]

   *  "description": a string containing a human-readable description of
      the gateway

   For example, a very simple (and not very helpful) description
   document:

   {
     "description": "The Example CDN configuration for example.com",
     "generated": "2023-08-21T23:20:50.52Z"
   }

   Processors SHOULD NOT fail if these members are not present.

   Additionally, the root object MAY contain any number of gateway
   descriptors; see Section 3.

   Unrecognised members of the root object MUST be ignored.

3.  Gateway Descriptors

   The following subsections list OPTIONAL information that may be
   included in the root object of a gateway description document.

   New gateway descriptors may be introduced by updating this
   specification.

3.1.  Site

   The "site" descriptor is a JSON object containing information about
   the HTTP server that the gateway exposes on behalf of the origin.  It
   is a JSON object that contains zero or more of the following members:

   *  "exposed-origins": an array of strings containing Unicode
      serializations of origins (Section 6.1 of [RFC6454]) that are
      exposed by the gateway

   *  "backend-origins": an array of strings containing Unicode
      serializations of origins that the gateway uses as origin
      server(s) for the exposed origin(s)

   For example:

   {
     "description": "The Example CDN configuration for example.com",
     "generated": "2023-08-21T23:20:50.52Z",
     "site": {
       "exposed-origins": ["https://www.example.com", "https://www.example.com"],
       "backend-origins": ["https://backend1.example.com", "https://backend2.example.com"]
     }
   }

   Note that this descriptor allows but is not sufficient to describe
   more complex arrangements; for example, different backend-origins for
   different URL path locations, or when one exposed-origin redirects
   all requests to the other.

3.2.  Gateway Source Address Lists

   The "gateway-sourcelists" descriptor is a JSON array of strings
   containing one or more URLs that can be used to fetch gateway source
   address lists.

   Their URLs MUST have a scheme of "https".  If multiple URLs are
   listed, their contents are combined to reconstruct the full list of
   source IP addresses for the gateway.  Consumers SHOULD respect HTTP
   caching rules when fetching lists, refreshing their contents as
   necessary once they become stale.

   For example:

   {
     "description": "The Example CDN configuration for example.com",
     "generated": "2023-08-21T23:20:50.52Z",
     "gateway-sourcelists": [
       "https://cdn.example.com/source-addresess/ipv4",
       "https://cdn.example.com/source-addresses/ipv6"
     ]
   }

   Gateway source address lists are textual documents (with a
   RECOMMENDED media type of "text/plain") whose format is one entry per
   line, with all whitespace being ignored and all content on a line
   after the "#" being ignored.  Each entry contains an IPv4 or IPv6
   address block, using "/" notation.

   For example:

   # My IP addresses
   192.0.2.0/24
     198.51.100.0/24   # TEST-NET-2

   2001:db8::/32

   ... contains three entries, "192.0.2.0/24", "198.51.100.0/24", and
   "2001:db8::/32".

3.3.  Gateway Header Authentication

   The "gateway-header-auth" descriptor is a JSON array of two strings
   representing a HTTP header field name and value that it will send in
   all HTTP requests to the origin, allowing the origin to discriminate
   them from other requests.

   For example:

   {
     "description": "The Example CDN configuration for example.com",
     "generated": "2023-08-21T23:20:50.52Z",
     "gateway-header-auth": ["Secret", "my$ecret"]
   }

   would imply that the gateway would send this HTTP header field in all
   requests to the origin:

   Secret: my$ecret

3.4.  Forwarded Host

   The "forwarded-host" descriptor is a boolean that indicates whether
   the Host request header field sent by the gateway is that which it
   received (one of the exposed origins) if true, or that of the backend
   origin selected if false.

   For example:

   {
     "description": "The Example CDN configuration for example.com",
     "generated": "2023-08-21T23:20:50.52Z",
     "forwarded-host": false
   }

   would imply that the gateway has rewritten the Host request header
   field will be rewritten to be that of the backend origin.

3.5.  HTTP Methods Allowed

   The "methods-allow" descriptor is a JSON array of case-sensitive
   strings that indicate the HTTP methods that the gateway will accept
   in requests, forwarding them to the backend origin or handling them
   locally as appropriate.

   The value "*" indicates that unrecognised methods are forwarded to
   the backend origin server.

   For example:

   {
     "description": "The Example CDN configuration for example.com",
     "generated": "2023-08-21T23:20:50.52Z",
     "methods-allow": ["GET", "HEAD", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS"]
   }

3.6.  Targeted Cache Control

   The "targeted-cc" descriptor is a JSON array of strings indicating
   the targeted cache-control header field(s) [TARGETED] supported by
   the gateway, in order of precedence (i.e., first entry overrides
   later entries)

   For example:

   {
     "description": "The Example CDN configuration for example.com",
     "generated": "2023-08-21T23:20:50.52Z",
     "targeted-cc": [
       "ExampleCDN-Cache-Control",
       "CDN-Cache-Control"
     ]
   }

3.7.  Invalidation API

   The "invalidation-api" descriptor is a JSON object that contains
   information about the gateway's deployment of [INVALIDATION].

   These objects can contain the following members and values:

   *  "uri": a string conveying the URI of the Invalidation Resource
      (Section 2 of [INVALIDATION])

   *  "selectors": an array of strings indicating the selectors
      (Section 3.1 of [INVALIDATION]) that the Invalidation Resource
      supports

   *  "purge": a boolean indicating whether the Invalidation Resource
      supports the "purge" member in requests (see Section 3 of
      [INVALIDATION])

   *  "p95-latency": an integer indicating the number of milliseconds
      that 95% of invalidation requests should be fully applied to the
      scope indicated by the description.

   For example:

   {
     "description": "The Example CDN configuration for example.com",
     "generated": "2023-08-21T23:20:50.52Z",
     "invalidation-api": {
       "uri": "https://api.cdn.example.com/invalidate",
       "selectors": ["uri", "uri-prefix", "group"],
       "purge": true,
       "p95-latency": 2000
     }
   }

   If the "api-auth" descriptor (Section 3.8) is present, the
   authentication details there SHOULD be sent on all requests to the
   invalidation API.

3.8.  API Authentication

   The "api-auth" descriptor is a string representing a Bearer HTTP
   authentication (Section 2.1 of [BEARER]) to be used to authenticate
   the backend origin in interaction with Gateway APIs.

   For example:

   {
     "description": "The Example CDN configuration for example.com",
     "generated": "2023-08-21T23:20:50.52Z",
     "api-auth": "mF_9.B5f-4.1JqM"
   }

3.9.  Vendor Extensions

   The "vendor" descriptor is a JSON object that can be use for gateway-
   and vendor-specific extensions to the format.  Its members' names
   MUST be in internet hostname format, associating a name associated
   with the gateway and/or its vendor.  The contents of member values
   are under the control of that party.

   For example:

   {
     "description": "The Example CDN configuration for example.com",
     "generated": "2023-08-21T23:20:50.52Z",
     "vendor": {
       "cdn.example.com": {
         "foo": "bar",
         "1": 2
       }
     }
   }
