1.  Introduction

   HTTP/2 [RFC7540] allows clients to coalesce different origins
   [RFC6454] onto the same connection when certain conditions are met.
   In some cases, the server is not authoritative for a coalesced
   origin, so the 421 (Misdirected Request) status code was defined.

   Using a status code in this manner allows clients to recover from
   misdirected requests, but at the penalty of adding latency.  To
   address that, this specification defines a new HTTP/2 frame type,
   "ORIGIN", to allow servers to indicate what origins a connection is
   authoritative for.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  The ORIGIN HTTP/2 Frame

   The ORIGIN HTTP/2 frame ([RFC7540], Section 4) indicates what
   origin(s) [RFC6454] the sender considers this connection
   authoritative for (in the sense of [RFC7540], Section 10.1).

   The ORIGIN frame is a non-critical extension to HTTP/2.  Endpoints
   that do not support this frame can safely ignore it.

   It MUST occur on stream 0; an ORIGIN frame on any other stream is
   invalid and MUST be ignored.

   When received by a client, it can be used to inform HTTP/2 connection
   coalescing (see [RFC7540], Section 9.1.1), but does not relax the
   requirement there that the server is authoritative.

   If multiple ORIGIN frames are received on the same connection, only
   the most recent is to be considered current.

Internet-Draft                ORIGIN Frames                November 2015


   Once an ORIGIN frame has been received and processed, clients that
   implement this specification SHOULD NOT use that connection for a
   given origin if it did not appear within the current ORIGIN frame.

   The ORIGIN frame type is 0xb (decimal 11).

   +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
   |         Origin-Len (16)       | Origin? (*)                 ...
   +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+

   The ORIGIN frame contains the following fields, sets of which may be
   repeated within the frame to indicate multiple origins:

   Origin-Len: An unsigned, 16-bit integer indicating the length, in
   octets, of the Origin field.  Origin: An optional sequence of
   characters containing the ASCII serialization of an origin
   ([RFC6454], Section 6.2) that the sender believes this connection is
   authoritative for.

   The ORIGIN frame does not define any flags.  It can contain one or
   more Origin-Len/Origin pairs.

   The ORIGIN frame is processed hop-by-hop.  An intermediary must not
   forward ORIGIN frames.

   Clients configured to use a proxy MUST ignore any ORIGIN frames
   received from it.

2.  Security Considerations

   Clients that blindly trust the ORIGIN frame's contents will be
   vulnerable to a large number of attacks; hence the reinforcement that
   this specification does not relax the requirement for server
   authority in [RFC7540], Section 10.1.
