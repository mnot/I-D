    <abstract>
      <t>Historically, designers and implementers of application protocols have often distinguished between "standard" and "non-standard" parameters by prefixing the latter with the string "X-" or similar constructions.  In practice, this convention causes more problems than it solves.  Therefore, this document deprecates the "X-" convention for most application protocol parameters.</t>

    <section title="Introduction" anchor="introduction">
      <t>Many application protocols use named parameters to identify data (media types, header fields in Internet mail messages and HTTP requests, etc.).  Historically, designers and implementers of application protocols have often distinguished between "standard" and "non-standard" parameters by prefixing the latter with the string "X-" or similar constructions (e.g., "x."), where the "X" is commonly understood to stand for "eXperimental" or "eXtension".</t>
      <t>Although in theory the "X-" convention was a good way to avoid collisions (and attendant interoperability problems) between standard parameters and non-standard parameters, in practice the costs associated with the advancement of non-standard parameters into the standards space have outweighed the benefits.  Therefore this document deprecates the "X-" convention for most application protocols and makes specific recommendations about how to proceed in a world without the distinction between standard and non-standard parameters.</t>
      <t>See <xref target="background"/> for background information about the history of the "X-" convention, and <xref target="analysis"/> for the reasoning that led to the recommendations in this document.</t>

<abstract>
<t>Many protocols make use of identifiers consisting of constants and other well-known values. Even after a protocol has been defined and deployment has begun, new values may need to be assigned (e.g., for a new option type in DHCP, or a new encryption or authentication transform for IPsec). To ensure that such quantities have consistent values and interpretations across all implementations, their assignment must be administered by a central authority. For IETF protocols, that role is provided by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).&lt;/t>&lt;t> In order for IANA to manage a given namespace prudently, it needs guidelines describing the conditions under which new values can be assigned or when modifications to existing values can be made. If IANA is expected to play a role in the management of a namespace, IANA must be given clear and concise instructions describing that role. This document discusses issues that should be considered in formulating a policy for assigning values to a namespace and provides guidelines for authors on the specific text that must be included in documents that place demands on IANA.&lt;/t>&lt;t> This document obsoletes RFC 2434. This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</t></abstract></front>

<title>Assigning Experimental and Testing Numbers Considered Useful</title>
<author initials='T.' surname='Narten' fullname='T. Narten'>

<date year='2004' month='January' />
<abstract>
<t>When experimenting with or extending protocols, it is often necessary to use some sort of protocol number or constant in order to actually test or experiment with the new function, even when testing in a closed environment.  For example, to test a new DHCP option, one needs an option number to identify the new function.  This document recommends that when writing IANA Considerations sections, authors should consider assigning a small range of numbers for experimentation purposes that implementers can use when testing protocol extensions or other new features.  This document reserves some ranges of numbers for experimentation purposes in specific protocols where the need to support experimentation has been identified.</t></abstract></front>

<abstract>
<t>This is a slight revision of RFC 686, mainly differing in the discussion of print files.  Reading several RFCs that I (sigh) never heard of before writing 686 has convinced me that although I was right all along it was for the wrong reasons.  The list of reply codes is also slightly different to reflect the four lists in RFCs 354, 454, 542, and 640 more completely.  Let me also suggest that if there are no objections before June 1, everyone take it as official that HELP should return 200, that SRVR should be used as discussed below, and that "permanent" 4xx errors be changed to 5xx.  And thanks to Jon Postel who just spent all evening helping me straighten this all out.</t>
<t>Aside from a cry of anguish by the site responsible for the security hassle described below, I've only had one comment on this, which was unfavorable but, alas, unspecific.  Let me just say, in the hopes of avoiding more such, that I am not just trying to step on toes for the fun of it, and that I don't think the positive changes to FTP-1 proposed here are necessarily the best possible thing.  What they are, I think, is easily doable. The great-FTP-in-the-sky isn't showing any signs of universal acceptability, and it shouldn't stand in the way of solving immediate problems.</t>
<t>Leaving Well Enough Alone</t>
<t>I recently decided it was time for an overhaul of our FTP user and server programs.  This was my first venture into the world of network protocols, and I soon discovered that there was a lot we were doing wrong--and a few things that everyone seemed to be doing differently from each other.  When I enquired about this, the response from some quarters was "Oh, you're running Version 1!"</t></abstract></front>

<abstract>
<t>STD 11, RFC 822, defines a message representation protocol specifying considerable detail about US-ASCII message headers, and leaves the message content, or message body, as flat US-ASCII text.  This set of documents, collectively called the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, or MIME, redefines the format of messages to allow for</t>
<t>(1)   textual message bodies in character sets other than US-ASCII,</t>
<t>(2)   an extensible set of different formats for non-textual message bodies,</t>
<t>(3)   multi-part message bodies, and</t>
<t>(4)   textual header information in character sets other than US-ASCII.</t>
<t>These documents are based on earlier work documented in RFC 934, STD 11, and RFC 1049, but extends and revises them.  Because RFC 822 said so little about message bodies, these documents are largely orthogonal to (rather than a revision of) RFC 822.</t>
<t>This initial document specifies the various headers used to describe the structure of MIME messages. The second document, RFC 2046, defines the general structure of the MIME media typing system and defines an initial set of media types. The third document, RFC 2047, describes extensions to RFC 822 to allow non-US-ASCII text data in Internet mail header fields. The fourth document, RFC 2048, specifies various IANA registration procedures for MIME-related facilities. The fifth and final document, RFC 2049, describes MIME conformance
  criteria as well as providing some illustrative examples of MIME message formats, acknowledgements, and the bibliography.</t>
<t>These documents are revisions of RFCs 1521, 1522, and 1590, which themselves were revisions of RFCs 1341 and 1342.  An appendix in RFC 2049 describes differences and changes from previous versions.</t></abstract></front>

<abstract>
<t>
   STD 11, RFC 822, defines a message representation protocol specifying
   considerable detail about US-ASCII message headers, and leaves the
   message content, or message body, as flat US-ASCII text.  This set of
   documents, collectively called the Multipurpose Internet Mail
   Extensions, or MIME, redefines the format of messages to allow for

<list>
<t>
   (1) textual message bodies in character sets other than US-ASCII,
</t>
<t>
   (2) an extensible set of different formats for non-textual message
       bodies,
</t>
<t>
   (3) multi-part message bodies, and
</t>
<t>
   (4) textual header information in character sets other than US-ASCII.
</t></list></t>
<t>
   These documents are based on earlier work documented in RFC 934, STD
   11, and RFC 1049, but extends and revises them.  Because RFC 822 said
   so little about message bodies, these documents are largely
   orthogonal to (rather than a revision of) RFC 822.
</t>
<t>
   This particular document is the third document in the series.  It
   describes extensions to RFC 822 to allow non-US-ASCII text data in
   Internet mail header fields.
   Other documents in this series include:

<list>
<t>
   + RFC 2045, which specifies the various headers used to describe
     the structure of MIME messages.
</t>
<t>
   + RFC 2046, which defines the general structure of the MIME media
     typing system and defines an initial set of media types,
</t>
<t>
   + RFC 2048, which specifies various IANA registration procedures
     for MIME-related facilities, and
</t>
<t>
   + RFC 2049, which describes MIME conformance criteria and
     provides some illustrative examples of MIME message formats,
     acknowledgements, and the bibliography.
</t></list></t>
<t>
   These documents are revisions of RFCs 1521, 1522, and 1590, which
   themselves were revisions of RFCs 1341 and 1342.  An appendix in RFC
   2049 describes differences and changes from previous versions.

   This memo defines the profile of the MIME Content-Type  for
   directory information for a white-pages person object, based on a
   vCard electronic business card. The profile definition is independent
   of any particular directory service or protocol. The profile is
   defined for representing and exchanging a variety of information
   about an individual (e.g., formatted and structured name and delivery
   addresses, email address, multiple telephone numbers, photograph,
   logo, audio clips, etc.). The directory information used by this
   profile is based on the attributes for the person object defined in
   the X.520 and X.521 directory services recommendations. The profile
   also provides the method for including a  representation of a
   white-pages directory entry within the MIME Content-Type defined by
   the  document.

<t>
A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact sequence of characters
that identifies an abstract or physical resource.  This specification
defines the generic URI syntax and a process for resolving URI references
that might be in relative form, along with guidelines and security
considerations for the use of URIs on the Internet.
The URI syntax defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid URIs,
allowing an implementation to parse the common components of a URI
reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every
possible identifier.  This specification does not define a generative
grammar for URIs; that task is performed by the individual
specifications of each URI scheme.

<abstract>
<t>This memo documents a process intended to organize the future development of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and related work in the Real-time Applications and Infrastructure (RAI) Area.  As the environments in which SIP is deployed grow more numerous and diverse, modifying or extending SIP in certain ways may threaten the interoperability and security of the protocol; however, the IETF process must also cater to the realities of existing deployments and serve the needs of the implementers working with SIP.  This document therefore defines the functions of two long-lived working groups in the RAI Area that are, respectively, responsible for the maintenance of the core SIP specifications and the development of new efforts to extend and apply work in this space.  This document obsoletes RFC 3427.  This memo documents an Internet Best Current Practice.</t></abstract></front>

    <section title="Background" anchor="background">
      <t>The beginnings of the "X-" convention can be found in a suggestion made by Brian Harvey in 1975 with regard to FTP parameters <xref target='RFC691'/>:</t>
      <t><list style='empty'><t>Thus, FTP servers which care about the distinction between Telnet print and non-print could implement SRVR N and SRVR T.  Ideally the SRVR parameters should be registered with Jon Postel to avoid conflicts, although it is not a disaster if two sites use the same parameter for different things.  I suggest that parameters be allowed to be more than one letter, and that an initial letter X be used for really local idiosyncracies.</t></list></t>
      <t>This "X" prefix was subsequently used in <xref target='RFC737'/>, <xref target='RFC743'/>, and <xref target='RFC775'/>.  This usage was noted in <xref target='RFC1123'/>:</t>
      <t><list style='empty'><t>FTP allows "experimental" commands, whose names begin with "X".  If these commands are subsequently adopted as standards, there may still be existing implementations using the "X" form....  All FTP implementations SHOULD recognize both forms of these commands, by simply equating them with extra entries in the command lookup table.</t></list></t>
      <t>The "X-" convention has been used for email header fields since at least the publication of <xref target='RFC822'/> in 1982, which distinguished between "Extension-fields" and "user-defined-fields" as follows:</t>
      <t><list style='empty'><t>The prefatory string "X-" will never be used in the names of Extension-fields.  This provides user-defined fields with a protected set of names.</t></list></t>
      <t>That rule was restated by <xref target='RFC1154'/> as follows:</t>
      <t><list style='empty'><t>Keywords beginning with "X-" are permanently reserved to implementation-specific use.  No standard registered encoding keyword will ever begin with "X-".</t></list></t>
      <t>This convention continued with various specifications for media types (<xref target='RFC2045'/>, <xref target='RFC2046'/>, <xref target='RFC2047'/>), HTTP headers (<xref target='RFC2068'/>, <xref target='RFC2616'/>), vCard parameters and properties (<xref target='RFC2426'/>), Uniform Resource Names (<xref target='RFC3406'/>), LDAP field names (<xref target='RFC4512'/>), and other technologies.</t>
      <t>However, use of the "X-" prefix in email headers was effectively deprecated between the publication of <xref target='RFC822'/> in 1982 and the publication of <xref target='RFC2822'/> in 2001 by removing the distinction between the "extension-field" construct and the "user-defined-field" construct (a similar change happened with regard to Session Initiation Protocol "P-" headers when <xref target='RFC3427'/> was obsoleted by <xref target='RFC5727'/>).</t>
      <t>Despite the fact that parameters containing the "X-" string have been effectively deprecated in email headers, they continue to be used in a wide variety of application protocols.  The two primary situations motivating such use are:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='numbers'>
          <t>Experiments that are intended to possibly be standardized in the future, if they are successful.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
          <t>Extensions that are intended to never be standardized because they are intended only for use in implementation-specific applications or on private networks.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>Use of this naming convention is not mandated by the Internet Standards Process <xref target='BCP9'/> or IANA registration rules <xref target='BCP26'/>.  Rather it is an individual choice by each specification that references the convention or each administrative process that chooses to use it.  In particular, some standards track RFCs have interpreted the convention in a normative way (e.g., <xref target='RFC822'/> and <xref target='RFC5451'/>).</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Analysis" anchor="analysis">
      <t>The primary problem with the "X-" convention is that non-standard parameters have a tendency to advance into the protected space of standard parameters (whether de jure or de facto), thus introducing the need for migration from the "X-" name to the standard name.  Migration, in turn, introduces interoperability issues because older implementations will support only the "X-" name and newer implementations might support only the standard name.  To preserve interoperability, newer implementations simply support the "X-" name forever, which means that the non-standard name has become a de facto standard (thus obviating the need for segregation of the name space into "standard" and "non-standard" areas in the first place).</t>
      <t>We have already seen this phenomenon at work with regard to FTP in the quote from <xref target='RFC1123'/> in the previous section.  The HTTP community had the same experience with the "x-gzip" and "x-compressed" media types, as noted in <xref target='RFC2068'/>:</t>
      <t><list style='empty'><t>For compatibility with previous implementations of HTTP, applications should consider "x-gzip" and "x-compress" to be equivalent to "gzip" and "compress" respectively.</t></list></t>
      <t>A similar example can be found in <xref target='RFC5064'/>, which defined the "Archived-At" message header field but also found it necessary to define and register the "X-Archived-At" field:</t>
      <t><list style='empty'><t>For backwards compatibility, this document also describes the X-Archived-At header field, a precursor of the Archived-At header field.  The X-Archived-At header field MAY also be parsed, but SHOULD NOT be generated.</t></list></t>
      <t>One of the original reasons for segregation of name spaces into standard and non-standard areas was the perceived difficulty of registering names.  However, the solution to that problem has been simpler registration rules, such as those provided by <xref target='RFC3864'/> and <xref target='RFC4288'/>, as well as separate registries for permanent and provisional names, as explained in <xref target='RFC4288'/>:</t>
      <t><list style='empty'><t>[W]ith the simplified registration procedures described above for vendor and personal trees, it should rarely, if ever, be necessary to use unregistered experimental types.  Therefore, use of both "x-" and "x." forms is discouraged.</t></list></t>
      <t>Furthermore, often standardization of a non-standard parameter or protocol element leads to subtly different behavior (e.g., the standard version might have different security properties as a result of security review provided during the standardization process).  If implementers treat the old, non-standard parameter and the new, standard parameter as equivalent, interoperability and security problems can ensue.</t>
      <t>For similar considerations with regard to the "P-" convention in the Session Initiation Protocol, see <xref target='RFC5727'/>.</t>
      <t>In some situations, segregating the parameters name space used in a given application protocol can be justified:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='numbers'>
          <t>When it is extremely unlikely that some parameters will ever be standardized.  However, in this case implementation-specific and private-use parameters can be Uniform Resource Identifiers <xref target='RFC3986'/> (e.g., "http://example.com/foo") or can be prepended with a string that is derived from the name or primary domain name of the organization that has defined the parameter (e.g., "ExampleInc-foo", "VND.ExampleInc.foo", or "com.example.foo").  Similarly, truly experimental parameters can be given meaningless names such as nonsense words, the output of a hash function, or UUIDs <xref target='RFC4122'/>.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
          <t>When parameter names might have significant meaning.  However, this case is rare, since implementers can almost always find a synonym for an existing term (e.g., "urgency" instead of "priority") or simply invent a more creative name (e.g., "get-it-there-fast").<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
          <t>When parameter names need to be very short (e.g., as in <xref target='RFC5646'/> for language tags).  However, in this case it can be more efficient to assign numbers instead of human-readable names (e.g., as in <xref target='RFC2939'/> for DCHP options) and to leave a certain numeric range for implementation-specific extensions or private use (e.g., as with the codec numbers used with the Session Description Protocol <xref target='RFC4566'/>).</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>There are three primary objections to deprecating the "X-" convention as a best practice for application protocols:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='numbers'>
          <t>Implementers are easily confused and can't be expected to know that a parameter is non-standard unless it contains the "X-" prefix.  However, implementers already are quite flexible about using both prefixed and non-prefixed names based on what works in the field, so the distinction between de facto names (e.g., "X-foo") and de jure names (e.g., "foo") is effectively meaningless.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
          <t>Collisions are undesirable and it would be bad for both a standard parameter "foo" and a non-standard parameter "foo" to exist simultaneously. However, names are almost always cheap, so an experimental, implementation-specific, or private-use name of "foo" does not prevent a standards development organization from issuing a similarly creative name such as "bar".<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
          <t><xref target='BCP82'/> is entitled "Assigning Experimental and Testing Numbers Considered Useful" and therefore implies that the "X-" prefix is also useful for experimental parameters.  However, BCP 82 addresses the need for protocol numbers when the pool of such numbers is strictly limited (e.g., DHCP options) or when a number is absolutely required even for purely experimental purposes (e.g., the Protocol field of the IP header).  In almost all application protocols that make use of protocol parameters (including email headers, media types, HTTP headers, vCard parameters and properties, URNs, and LDAP field names), the name space is not limited or constrained in any way, so there is no need to assign a block of names for private use or experimental purposes (see also <xref target='BCP26'/>).</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>Therefore it appears that segregating the parameter space into a standard area and a non-standard area has few if any benefits, and has at least one significant cost in terms of interoperability.</t>
