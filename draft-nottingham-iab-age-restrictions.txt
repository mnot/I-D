            Architectural Considerations of Age Restriction
              draft-nottingham-iab-age-restrictions-latest

Abstract

   Around the world, authorities are considering (and in some cases
   implementing) age restriction systems for Internet content.  This
   document explores the potential for unwanted impacts upon the
   Internet by these systems and makes recommendations about the
   properties they should have, if they are to be a successful part of
   the Internet infrastructure.

1.  Introduction

   Increasingly, policymakers are proposing regulation that restricts
   what content young people can access online.  A recurring theme in
   these efforts is that it is no longer considered sufficient to rely
   on self-assertions of age.  A number of jurisdictions have enacted -
   or are in the process of enacting – laws that take steps to provide
   stronger guarantees that children are not exposed to certain content.

   Age restrictions are already deployed on the Internet; for example,
   some Web sites already require some proof of age to create an
   account.  However, when deployments become more widespread, they tend
   to have greater impact upon the Internet architecture.  Systems that
   are designed for deployment in a single, homogenous domain rarely are
   suitable for the diversity of requirements and considerations that
   apply to Internet-scale systems.

   Section 2 catalogues the risks that such systems might incur,
   expressed in terms of the Internet's architectural principles.
   Section 3 suggests the properties that an age restriction system
   should have to be a healthy part of the Internet infrastructure.

2.  Risks of Age Restriction

   This section catalogues risks that age restriction systems might
   encounter, expressed in terms of the Internet's architectural
   principles.

2.1.  Centralization

   Inherently, any age restriction system involves controlling access to
   content and services on the Internet.  That control -- along with the
   potential for access to information about people's activities online
   that comes with it -- is immensely valuable to various parties, often
   for purposes other than those that policymakers have in mind.

   How and where that control is exercised thus becomes an important
   consideration.

   For example, if an age restriction system requires verification by a
   single party, that party will have access to a significant amount of
   sensitive information about people's activities on the Internet.
   Such systems can be leveraged for a variety of purposes beyond those
   intended by policymakers -- both by that party itself, and by
   individuals, organized criminals, and nation-state actors who are
   able to perform successful cyber attacks against it.

   It also means that any party operating the system has extraordinary
   access, and thus risk of abuse, especially if their incentives are
   not aligned with other participants in the system.

   In both cases, having only one entity operating the system increases
   the associated risks dramatically, as this effectively centralizes
   control in their hands while simultaneously presenting a single
   target to attackers.

   Thus, centralisation is a primary consideration for age restriction
   systems.  Internet infrastructure is designed in a way to avoid
   centralization where it is technically possible, or to mitigate
   centralization risks where it is not.  [CENTRALIZATION] explores
   these issues greater detail.

2.2.  Privacy and Security

   It is technically challenging to design an age restriction system
   that exhibits the security and privacy properties expected of
   Internet standards.

   A system that exposes the Internet services that a person uses to the
   a verifying entity puts that person at risk, because it allows the
   verifying entity to develop a profile of their Internet activity and
   track them.  The risks here are similar to those seen on the Web,
   which the Internet standards community has expended considerable
   effort to mitigate (see e.g., [RFC7258]).

   A system that exposes attributes of the person whose age is being
   verified to the service they are accessing also creates privacy and
   security risks for them, because many services do not need access to
   those attributes, and are likely to abuse them.  For example, an age
   verification system that also exposes the country a person is a
   citizen of allows sites to discriminate against that attribute, which
   is beyond the purpose of age restriction.

   Exposing information about Internet users to third parties -- whether
   verifiers, services, or others -- creates powerful incentives.  In
   particular, commercial interests desire access to it to be able to
   track activity across the Internet so that this can be sold (to
   advertisers, insurers and others), and so they will use (and abuse)
   any facility that offers such information to learn about what people
   are doing.

   Critically, even small amounts of information can aid these purposes,
   because they can be aggregated with other information (like IP
   addresses, browser characteristics, and so on) to create a unique
   identifier for each Internet user.

2.3.  Barriers to Access

   Many existant proposals for age restriction systems require its users
   to have certain capabilities -- for example, a personal smartphone, a
   government credential, or a camera with certain resolution.

   Imposing these requirements means that some number of people will be
   disenfranchised from full use of the Internet – especially if age
   restriction becomes pervasive across many services.  At the scale of
   the entire Internet (or even in a single country), this can be a
   large number of disenfranchised people.

   For example, many people only have Internet access from public
   computers (such as those in libraries), and do not have exclusive or
   reliable access to a smartphone.  Others lack government-issued
   identity documents that some schemes rely upon.

   While such restrictions may be palatable in a closed system (such as
   on a single platform or in a single jurisdiction), they are not
   suitable for Internet-wide deployment.

2.4.  Fragmentation

   If an age restriction system relies too much on legal controls rather
   than technical capabilities, those controls are likely to be
   inconsistently applied in different jurisdictions, leading to
   different experiences for Internet users around the globe.

   Likewise, a solution that requires special access to computers (such
   as in “trusted platform modules” or otherwise mandates conformance on
   people’s computers introduces a risk of limiting the kinds of
   computers that can be used on the Internet – for example, Open Source
   Operating Systems and Web browsers are generally unable to provide
   such assurances.

   While these tradeoffs may be reasonable in a single jurisdiction, too
   many differences will create barriers to Internet-wide deployment of
   services, creating not only centralization risks, but also
   fragmentation risks -- that the Internet will work in different ways
   depending on where you are.

2.5.  An Age-Gated Internet

   The Internet is designed to be used without permission, both be
   servers and clients.  Easy-to-use age verification mechanisms risk
   creating a ‘papers please’ Internet, where a credential is required
   to access large portions of the Internet.  Such an outcome would
   amplify the other harms listed.

   This risk is heightened if there are incentives for sites to deploy
   it, such as access to non-age data.

   Access to more granular age information also heightens many risks,
   because it makes a verification system simultaneously useful in a
   broader variety of cases, and more attractive for misuse, because it
   offers more information about users.
