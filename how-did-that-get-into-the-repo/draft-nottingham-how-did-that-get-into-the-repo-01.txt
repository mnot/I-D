1.  Introduction

   It has become increasingly common to use bearer tokens as an
   authentication mechanism.

   Unfortunately, the number of security incidents involving accidental
   disclosure of these tokens has also increased.  For example, we now
   regularly hear about a developer committing an access token to a
   public source code repository, either because they didn't realise it
   was included in the committed code, or because they didn't realise
   the implications of its disclosure.

   This specification registers the "secret-token" URI scheme to aid
   prevention of such accidental disclosures.  When tokens are easier to
   unambiguously identify, they can trigger warnings in Continuous
   Integration systems, or be used in source code repositories
   themselves.  They can also be scanned for separately.

   For example, if cloud.example.net issues access tokens to its clients
   for later use, and it does so by formatting them as secret-token
   URIs, tokens that "leak" into places that they don't belong are

   easier to identify.  This could be through a variety of mechanisms;
   for example, if repo.example.com can be configured to refuse commits
   containing secret-token URIs, it helps its customers avoid accidental
   disclosures.

   secret-token URIs are intended to aid in identification of generated
   secrets like API keys and similar tokens.  They are not intended for
   use in controlled situations where ephemeral tokens are used, such as
   things ike CSRF tokens.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses ABNF [RFC5234], including by reference the
   following rules: ALPHA, DIGIT.  It also uses the pchar rule from
   [RFC3986].

2.  The secret-token URI scheme

   The secret-token URI scheme identifies a token that is intended to be
   a secret.

   secret-token-URI    = secret-token-scheme ":" token
   secret-token-scheme = "secret-token"
   token               = 1*pchar

   See [RFC3986], Section 3.3 for a definition of pchar.  Disallowed
   characters - including non-ASCII characters - MUST be encoded into
   UTF-8 [RFC3629] and then percent-encoded ([RFC3986], Section 2.1).

   When a token is both generated and presented for authentication, the
   entire URI MUST be used, without changes.

   For example, given the URI:

   secret-token:E92FB7EB-D882-47A4-A265-A0B6135DC842%20foo

   This string (character-for-character, case-sensitive) will both be
   issued by the token authority, and required for later access.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the following value in the URI Scheme
   registry:

   o  Scheme name: secret-token

   o  Status: provisional

   o  Applications / protocols that use this scheme: none yet

   o  Contact: iesg@iesg.org

   o  Change Controller: IESG

   o  References: [this document]

4.  Security Considerations

   The token ABNF rule allows tokens as small as one character.  This is
   not recommended practice; applications should evaluate their
   requirements for entropy and issue tokens correspondingly.

   This URI scheme is intended to prevent accidental disclosure; it
   cannot prevent intentional disclosure.

   If it is difficult to correctly handle secret material, or unclear as
   to what the appropriate handling is, users might choose to obfuscate
   their secret tokens in order to evade detection (for example,
   removing the URI scheme for storage).  Clear guidelines and helpful
   tools are good mitigations here.
