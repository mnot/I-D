                   Reserving the 418 HTTP Status Code
                    draft-nottingham-thanks-larry-00

Abstract

   [RFC2324] was an April 1 RFC that lampooned the various ways HTTP was
   abused; one such abuse was the definition of the application-specific
   418 (I'm a Teapot) status code.

   In the intervening years, this status code has been widely
   implemented as an "Easter Egg", and therefore is effectively consumed
   by this use.

   This document changes 418 to the status of "Reserved" in the IANA
   HTTP Status Code registry to reflect that.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC2324] was an April 1 RFC that lampooned the various ways HTTP was
   abused; one such abuse was the definition of the application-specific
   418 (I'm a Teapot) status code.

   In the intervening years, this status code has been widely
   implemented as an "Easter Egg", and therefore is effectively consumed
   by this use.

   This document changes 418 to the status of "Reserved" in the IANA
   HTTP Status Code registry to reflect that.

   This indicates that the status code cannot be assigned to other
   applications currently.  If future circumstances require its use
   (e.g., exhaustion of all other 4NN status codes), it can be re-
   assigned to another use.

   Implementations are encouraged to avoid "squatting" on status codes
   in this manner; while there are a number of unassigned status codes
   in each range currently, unofficial, uncoordinated use makes the
   definition of new status codes more difficult over the lifetime of
   HTTP, which (hopefully) is a potentially very long period of time.

2.  IANA Considerations

   This document updates the following entry in the Hypertext Transfer
   Protocol (HTTP) Status Code Registry:

   o  Value: 418

   o  Description: Reserved

   o  Reference: [this document]

   IANA should also typographically distinguish "Unassigned" and
   "Reserved" in the registry descriptions, to prevent confusion.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document has no security content.
