		<t>This memo defines Web link types that invalidate HTTP caches, 
		along with an HTTP cache-control extension that allows caches that 
		understand those link types to use responses containing them. Together, 
		these mechanisms offer a way to avoid use of a response that has become
		stale due to another request that changes server-side state. Collectively,
		this is referred to as Linked Cache Invalidation (LCI).</t>

		<section title="Introduction">

			<t>In normal operation, a HTTP <xref target="RFC2616"/> cache will
      invalidate a stored response if a state-changing request (e.g., POST,
      PUT or DELETE) is made for that URI. HTTP also provides for such a
      state-changing request to invalidate related resources (using the
      Location and Content-Location headers in the response), but this is of
      limited utility, because those headers have defined semantics, and can
      only occur once each.</t>

			<t>Because of this, it is not practical to make a response that
			depends on the state of another resource cacheable. For example, an
			update to a blog entry might change several different resources, such
			as the user's summary page, the blog's "front" page, the blog's Atom
			feed, and of course the blog entry itself. If any of these resources
			is made cacheable, it will not reflect those changes, causing
			confusion if the user tries to verify that their changes have been
			correctly applied.</t>

			<t>This memo introduces new Web link relation types <xref
      target="RFC5988"/> that allow more fine-grained relationships between
      resources to be defined, so that caches can invalidate all related
      resources when the state of one changes. It also introduces a
      cache-control response extension, so that responses using the relations
      can be cached by implementations that understand these relations.</t>

			<section title="Example">
				
				<t>Taking the blog use case described above, imagine that we have 
					the following related resources:</t>
					
					<t><list style="symbols">
						<t>http://example.com/blog/2011/05/04/hi {the blog entry}</t>
						<t>http://example.com/blog/2011/05/04/hi/comments {full comments for the entry}</t>
						<t>http://example.com/blog/ {the blog "home"}</t>
						<t>http://example.com/users/bob/ {the user page, listing his entries}</t>
					</list></t>
				
				<t>When someone comments on Bob's blog entry, they might send a request
					like this:</t>
					
				<figure>
<artwork xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
POST /cgi-bin/blog.cgi HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 7890

[...]
]]></artwork>
				</figure>
					
				<t>This request (if successful) should have the effect of invalidating
        the related resources listed above.</t>
					
				<t>If the comment is successful, it's typical to redirect the client
					back to the original blog page, with a response like this:</t>
					
				<figure>
<artwork xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
HTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily
Location: http://example.com/blog/2011/05/04/hi
Content-Length: 0

]]></artwork>
				</figure>
					
				<t>Which would invalidate the blog entry URI, as per HTTP's normal
					operation.</t>
				
				<t>To invalidate the full comments page for the entry, the relationship
					can be described in that page's response headers:</t>
					
				<figure>
<artwork xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 5555
Link: </blog/2011/05/04/hi>; rel="inv-by"
Cache-Control: no-cache, inv-maxage=600

[...]
]]></artwork>
				</figure>
		
				<t>This declares that whenever the entry page (the target of the 
					link header) changes, this response (the full comments page) changes
					as well; it's invalidated by the link target.</t>
	
				<t>Note that the full comments page also carries a Cache-Control
					header that instructs "normal" caches not to reuse this response,
					but allows those caches that are aware of LCI to consider it
					fresh for ten minutes.</t>
									
				<t>To invalidate the blog home page and user page, it's impractical
					to list all of the resources that might change if a new entry is 
					posted; not only are there many of them, but their URLs might not
					be known when the pages are cached. To address this, the POST
					response itself can nominate resources to invalidate, using the
					'invalidates' relation, making that response:</t>
					
				<figure>
<artwork xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
HTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily
Location: http://example.com/blog/2011/05/04/hi
Link: <http://example.com/blog/>; rel="invalidates", 
      <http://example.com/users/bob/>; rel="invalidates"
Content-Length: 0

]]></artwork>
				</figure>

				<t>Depending on how important it is to see updates on the home
					page and user page, those responses can either allow caching
					regardless of support for LCI, like this:</t>

				<figure>
<artwork xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
Cache-Control: max-age=300
]]></artwork>
				</figure>
					
				<t>... or they can only allow caching by LCI-aware caches, like
					this:</t>
					
				<figure>
<artwork xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[
Cache-Control: no-cache, inv-maxage=300
]]></artwork>
				</figure>
									
				<t>Together, these techniques can be used to invalidate a variety
					of related responses.</t>
					
				<t>It is important to note that the invalidations are only effective
					in the caches that the client's request stream travels through.
					Typically, this means that the client making the changes (e.g.,
					the blog update above) will see the effects immediately, while
					other users whose requests travel through different caches will
					only see the changes once the content becomes stale (if it is
					cached).</t>
					
				<t>This makes Linked Cache Invalidation useful in a number of
					cases, but not all; when it's important that changes be propagated
					quickly, the freshness lifetime of cached responses can be reduced,
					but there will still be lag.</t>
					
				<t>When multiple caches are close together, the HyperText Caching
					Protocol (HTCP) <xref target="RFC2756"/> can be used to 
					propagate invalidation events between caches, reducing (but not 
					eliminating) these effects.</t>

		<section title="The 'inv-maxage' response cache-control extension"
    anchor="inv-maxage">

			<t>When present, the 'inv-maxage' cache-control extension indicates the
				number of seconds that caches who implement Linked Cache invalidation
				can consider responses fresh for.</t>

			<figure>
			<artwork xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[	
"inv-maxage" "=" delta-seconds				
]]></artwork>
			</figure>	

			<t>HTTP caches MAY, if they fully implement this specification,
      disregard the HTTP response cache-control directives 'no-cache',
      'max-age' and 's-maxage' and use the value of inv-maxage as a
      replacement for max-age.</t>

			<t>HTTP caches using inv-maxage to calculate freshness MUST invalidate
      all stored responses whose request-URIs (after normalisation) are
      indicated by the 'invalidates' link relation type contained in a
      successful response to a state-changing request, provided that they are
      allowed. </t>

			<t>HTTP caches using inv-maxage to calculate freshness MUST invalidate
      all stored responses containing the 'inv-by' relation that indicates the
      current request-URI (after normalisation) upon receipt of a successful
      response to a state-changing request.</t>
				
			<t>Here, a response is considered to "contain" a link relation if it is
      carried in the Link HTTP header <xref target="RFC5988"/>. I.e., it is
      not necessary to look at the response body.</t>
				
			<t>"Invalidate" means that the cache will either remove all stored
      responses related to the effective request URI, or will mark these as
      "invalid" and in need of a mandatory validation before they can be
      returned in response to a subsequent request.</t>
				
			<t>A "successful" response is one with a 2xx or redirecting 3xx (e.g.,
				301, 302, 303, 307) status code.</t>
			
			<t>A "state-changing" request is one with an unsafe method (e.g.,
				POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH), or one that is not known to be safe.</t> 
			
			<t>In this context, "normalisation" means, in the case of
			 a relative request-URI, that it is absolutised using the value of
			the Host request header and the appropriate protocol scheme.</t>
			
			<t>Finally, an invalidation based upon "invalidates" is "allowed" if 
				the host part of the request-URI (if absolute) or Host request header
				(if the request-URI is relative) matches the host part of the 
				target URI. This prevents some types of denial-of-service attacks.</t>
			
			<t>Implementations SHOULD effect invalidations when they become aware
				of changes through other means; e.g., HTCP <xref target="RFC2756"/>
				CLR messages, or upon invalidations caused by other links (i.e.,
				chained "cascades" of linked invalidations).</t>
			
		</section>

		<section title="Security Considerations">

			<t>Linked Cache Invalidation does not guarantee that invalidations will
				be effected; e.g., they can be lost due to network issues or cache
				downtime. Furthermore, it does not guarantee that all caches that 
				understand LCI will be made aware of invalidations that happen, because
				of how they originate.</t>
			<t>Therefore, care should be taken that LCI invalidations are not relied 
				upon (e.g., to purge sensitive content).</t>
			<t>Furthermore, while some care is taken to avoid denial-of-service
				attacks through invalidation, cache efficiency may still be impaired
				under certain circumstances (e.g., arranging for one request to
				invalidate a large number of responses), leading to a reduction in 
				service quality.</t>

		<section title="IANA Considerations">

			<t>This document registers two entries in the Link Relation Type
      Registry; see <xref target="invalidates"/> and <xref
      target="inv-by"/>.</t>
