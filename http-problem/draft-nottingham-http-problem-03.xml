		<section title="Introduction">
		  
      <t>HTTP <xref target="RFC2616"/> status codes are sometimes not
      sufficient to convey helpful information about an error. While humans
      behind Web browsers can be informed about the nature of the problem with
      an HTML response body, non-human consumers of so-called "HTTP APIs" are
      usually not.</t>

      <t>This specification defines simple JSON <xref target="RFC4627"/> and
      XML <xref target="W3C.REC-xml-20081126"/> document formats to suit this
      purpose. They are designed to be reused by HTTP APIs, which can identify
      distinct "problem types" specific to their needs.</t>
      
      <t>Thus, API clients can be informed of both the high-level error
      class (using the status code) and the finer-grained details of the
      problem (using one of these formats).</t>

      <t>Consider a response that indicates that the client's
      account doesn't have enough credit. The 403 Forbidden status code
      might be deemed most appropriate to use, as it will inform HTTP-generic
      software (such as client libraries, caches and proxies) of the general
      semantics of the response.</t>
      
      <t>However, that doesn't give the API client enough information about
      why the request was forbidden, the applicable account balance, or how to
      correct the problem. If these details are included in the response body
      in a machine-readable format, the client can treat it appropriately.</t>
      
      <t>This specification does this by identifying a specific type of
      problem (e.g., "out of credit") with a URI <xref target="RFC3986"/>;
      APIs can do this by nominating new URIs under their control, or by
      reusing existing ones.</t>

      <t>Additionally, problems can contain other information, such as a URI
      that identifies the specific occurrence of the problem (effectively
      giving an identifier to the concept "The time Joe didn't have enough
      credit last Thursday"), which may be useful for support or forensic
      purposes. See below for a full list.</t>
      
      <t>The data model for problem details is a JSON <xref target="RFC4627"/>
      object; when formatted as a JSON document, it uses the
      "application/api-problem+json" media type. <xref target="xml-syntax"/>
      defines how to express them in an equivalent XML format, which uses
      the "application/api-problem+xml" media type.</t>
      
      <t>Note that problem details are (naturally) not the only way to convey
      the details of a problem in HTTP; if the response is still a
      representation of a resource, for example, it's often preferable to
      accommodate describing the relevant details in that application's
      format.</t>
      
      <t>Instead, the aim of this specification is to define common error
      formats for those applications that need one, so that they aren't
      required to define their own, or worse, tempted to re-define the
      semantics of existing HTTP status codes.</t>

		<section title="Requirements">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
		</section>


    <section title="The Problem Details JSON Object">

      <t>The canonical model for problem details is a JSON <xref
      target="RFC4627"/> object.</t>

      <t>When serialised as a JSON document, that format is identified with
      the "application/api-problem+json" media type.</t>
      
      <t>For example, a HTTP response carrying JSON problem details:</t>

     <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Content-Type: application/api-problem+json
Content-Language: en

{
 "problemType": "http://example.com/probs/out-of-credit",
 "title": "You do not have enough credit.",
 "detail": "Your current balance is 30, but that costs 50.",
 "problemInstance": "http://example.net/account/12345/msgs/abc",
 "balance": 30,
 "accounts": ["http://example.net/account/12345",
              "http://example.net/account/67890"]
}]]></artwork></figure>

      <t>Here, the out-of-credit problem (identified by its problemType URI)
      indicates the reason for the 403 in "title", gives a reference for the
      specific problem occurrence with "problemInstance", gives
      occurrence-specific details in "detail", and adds two extensions;
      "balance" conveys the account's balance, and "account" gives a link
      where the account can be topped up.</t>

      <t>Note that "problemType" is case-sensitive in the JSON object, as are
      all other member names.</t>

      <section title="Required Members">
       
        <t>A problem details object MUST have the following members:</t>
       
        <t><list style='symbols'>

          <t>"problemType" (string) - An absolute URI <xref
          target="RFC3986"/> that identifies the problem type. When
          dereferenced, it SHOULD provide human-readable documentation for
          the problem type (e.g., using HTML).</t>

          <t>"title" (string) - A short, human-readable summary of the
          problem type. It SHOULD NOT change from occurrence to occurrence of
          the problem, except for purposes of localisation.</t>

        </list></t>
          
        <t>Consumers MUST use the problemType string as the primary
        identifier for the problem type; the title string is advisory, and
        included only for users who are not aware of the semantics of the
        URI, and don't have the ability to discover them (e.g., offline log
        analysis). Consumers SHOULD NOT automatically dereference the
        problemType URI.</t>
      
      </section>
      <section title="Optional Members">

        <t>Furthermore, a problem details object MAY have the following
        members:</t>

        <t><list style='symbols'>
        
          <t>"httpStatus" (number) - The HTTP status code set by the origin
          server for this occurrence of the problem.</t>
          
           <t>"detail" (string) - An human readable explanation specific to
          this occurrence of the problem.</t>
          
           <t>"problemInstance" (string) - An absolute URI that identifies the
          specific occurrence of the problem. It may or may not yield
          further information if dereferenced.</t>
        
         </list></t>

        <t>The httpStatus member, if present, is only advisory; it conveys the
        HTTP status code used for the convenience of the consumer. Generators
        MUST use the same status code in the actual HTTP response, to assure
        that generic HTTP software that does not understand this format still
        behaves correctly. See <xref target="security-considerations"/> for
        further caveats regarding its use.</t>

        <t>The detail member, if present, SHOULD focus on helping the
        client correct the problem, rather than giving debugging
        information.</t>
        
        <t>Consumers SHOULD NOT be parse the detail member for information;
        extensions are more suitable and less error-prone ways to obtain
        such information.</t>

      </section>
      <section title="Extension Members">
       
        <t>Finally, problem type definitions MAY extend the problem details
        object with additional members.</t>

        <t>Clients consuming problem details MUST ignore any such extensions
        that they don't recognise; this allows problem types to evolve and
        include additional information in the future.</t>

      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="defining" title="Defining New Problem Types">

      <t>When an HTTP API needs to define a response that indicates an error
      condition, it might be appropriate to do so by defining a new problem 
      type.</t>

      <t>Before doing so, it's important to understand what they are good for,
      and what's better left to other mechanisms.</t>

      <t>Problem details are not a debugging tool for the underlying
      implementation; rather, they are a way to expose greater detail about
      the HTTP interface itself. New problem types need to carefully consider
      the Security Considerations (<xref target="security-considerations"/>);
      in particular the risk of exposing attack vectors by exposing
      implementation internals through error messages.</t>
      
      <t>Likewise, truly generic problems – i.e., conditions that could
      potentially apply to any resource on the Web – are usually better
      expressed as plain status codes. For example, a "write access
      disallowed" problem is probably unnecessary, since a 403 Forbidden
      status code on a PUT request is self-explanatory.</t>

      <t>Finally, an application may have a more appropriate way to carry
      an error in a format that it already defines. Problem details
      are intended to avoid the necessity of establishing new "fault" or
      "error" document formats, not to replace existing domain-specific
      formats.</t>

      <t>That said, it is possible to add support for problem details to
      existing HTTP APIs using HTTP content negotiation (e.g., using the
      Accept request header to indicate a preference for this format).</t>

      <t>New problem type definitions MUST document:

      <list style="numbers">
        <t>A problemType URI (typically, with the "http" scheme),</t>
        <t>A title that appropriately describes it (think short), and</t>
        <t>The HTTP status code for it to be used with.</t>
      </list></t>

      <t>Problem types MAY specify the use of the Retry-After response
      header in appropriate circumstances.</t>

      <t>A problem's problemType URI SHOULD resolve to HTML documentation
      that explains how to resolve the problem.</t>

      <t>A problem type definition MAY specify additional members on the
      Problem Details object. For example, an extension might use
      typed links <xref target="RFC5988"/> to another resource that can be
      used by machines to resolve the problem.</t>

      <t>If such additional members are defined, their names SHOULD start with
      a letter (ALPHA, as per <xref target="RFC5234"/> and SHOULD consist of
      characters from ALPHA, DIGIT and "_" (so that it can be serialised in
      formats other than JSON), and SHOULD be three characters or longer.</t>

      <section title="Example">

        <t>For example, if your are publishing an HTTP API to your online
        shopping cart, you might need to indicate that the user is out of
        credit (our example from above), and therefore cannot make the
        purchase.</t>

        <t>If you already have an application-specific format that can
        accommodate this information, it's probably best to do that. However,
        if you don't, you might consider using one of the problem details
        formats; JSON if your API is JSON-based, or XML if it uses that
        convention.</t>
          
        <t>To do so, you might look for an already-defined problemType URI
        that suits your purposes. If one is available, you can reuse that URI
        by documenting use of both this specification and that specific
        URI value in your API.</t>
        
        <t>If one isn't available, you'd reference this specification, mint
        and document a new problemType URI (which ought to be under your
        control and stable over time), an appropriate title and the HTTP
        status code that it will be used with, along with what it means and
        how it should be handled. This information could appear within the
        rest of your API's documentation.</t>

        <t>In summary: a problemInstance URI will always identify a specific
        occurrence of a problem. On the other hand, problemType URIs can be
        reused if an appropriate description of a problem type is already
        available someplace else, or they can be created for new problem
        types.</t>

		<section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations">

        <t>When defining a new problem type, the information included must be
        carefully vetted. Likewise, when actually generating a problem –
        however it is serialised – the details given must also be
        scrutinised.</t>
         
        <t>Risks include leaking information that can be exploited to
        compromise the system, access to the system, or the privacy of users
        of the system.</t>
		  
        <t>Generators providing links to occurrence information are encouraged
        to avoid making implementation details such as a stack dump available
        through the HTTP interface, since this can expose sensitive details of
        the server implementation, its data, and so on.</t>
            
        <t>The "httpStatus" member duplicates the information available in the
        HTTP status code itself, thereby bringing the possibility of
        disagreement between the two. Their relative precedence is not clear,
        since a disagreement might indicate that (for example) an intermediary
        has modified the HTTP status code in transit. As such, those defining
        problem types as well as generators and consumers of problems need to
        be aware that generic software (such as proxies, load balancers,
        firewalls, virus scanners) are unlikely to know of or respect the
        status code conveyed in this member.</t>

   <t>Extension arrays and objects can be serialised into the XML format by
   considering an element containing a child or children to represent an
   object, except for elements that contain only child element(s) named 'i',
   which are considered arrays. For example, an alternate version of the
