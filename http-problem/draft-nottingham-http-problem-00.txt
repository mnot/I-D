           Indicating Details of Problems to Machines in HTTP
                    draft-nottingham-http-problem-00

Abstract

   This specification proposes a "Problem Detail" as an extensible way
   to carry machine-readable details of HTTP errors in a response, to
   avoid the need to invent new response formats for non-human
   consumers.

Note to Readers

   This specification is tentative (as all Internet-Drafts are).  It's
   not yet clear whether defining this format will improve things enough
   to balance out the harm it may cause, and so it may disappear at any
   time.  Using it before it becomes an RFC may subject you to ridicule;
   you have been warned.

   What's the problem?  In a nutshell, this sort of thing might
   encourage tighter coupling, making applications more brittle.  On the
   other hand, lots of people are doing this already, so having a common
   way to do it -- with lots of caveats about how it can be misused --
   might be better.  Stay tuned.

Internet-Draft               Problem Details                   July 2012


1.  Introduction

   While HTTP [RFC2616] defines the status code as the primary indicator
   of response semantics, it is sometimes not fine-grained enough to
   convey helpful information about the error, particularly to non-human
   consumers.

   For example, consider a 403 Forbidden response that indicates that
   the client's account doesn't have enough credit.  While this can be
   adequately expressed in HTML if it's presented to a human in front of
   a Web browser, a non-browser client will have difficulty
   understanding the response, because it doesn't understand the
   structure of the markup.

   This specification proposes a "Problem Detail" as an extensible way
   to carry machine-readable details of errors in a response, to avoid
   the need to invent new response formats.

   Problem details have:
   o  A generic status, identified and solely conveyed by the HTTP
      status code <http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/>.
      For example, "403 Forbidden".
   o  An problem type that refines the status code semantics, identified
      by an absolute URI [RFC3986] and paired with a summary title.
   o  Optionally, detail that is specific to an instance of the problem.

   This specification defines a common data model for problem details as
   a JSON [RFC4627] object.  That object can be serialised as an
   "application/json-problem" HTTP response, or it can be conveyed using
   a Link HTTP response header field [RFC5988].

   Future work may include defining a HTML Microformat
   <http://microformats.org/> that allows this information to be carried
   in an HTML document as well.


2.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  The Problem Details JSON Object

   The canonical format for problem details is a JSON [RFC4627]
   document, identified with the "application/json-problem" media type.
   Its root object has the following properties:



Nottingham               Expires January 4, 2013                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft               Problem Details                   July 2012


   o  "describedby" (string) - A URL that identifies the type of
      problem.  When dereferenced, it SHOULD provide human-readable
      documentation (e.g., using HTML).
   o  "title" (string) - A short, human-readable summary of the problem.
      It SHOULD NOT change from instance to instance of the problem,
      except for purposes of localisation.
   o  "detail" (string) - Optionally, additional, human readable detail
      specific to this instance of the problem.

   Problem details, when serialised as JSON objects, MUST include the
   "describedby" and "title" properties.  The "detail" property is
   always OPTIONAL.

   Problem types MAY extend their instances with additional properties.
   For example:

      HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
      Content-Type: application/json-problem
      Content-Language: en

      {
        "describedby": "http://example.com/probs/out-of-credit",
        "title": "You do not have enough credits.",
        "detail": "Your current balance is 30, but that costs 50.",
        "balance": 30,
        "account": "http://api.example.com/account/12345"
      }

   Here, the out-of-credit problem (identified by its URI) indicates the
   reason for the 403 in "title", gives instance-specific details in
   "detail", and adds two extensions; "balance" conveys the account's
   balance, and "account" gives a link where the account can be topped
   up.

   Note that "describedby" is case-sensitive in the JSON object, as are
   all other property names.


4.  Expressing Problems with Link Headers

   Because resources often use formats other than JSON to convey human-
   readable problem details, it is also possible to serialise Problem
   Details for non-browser consumption alongside them using a Link
   response header field [RFC5988].  For example:

Internet-Draft               Problem Details                   July 2012


      HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
      Content-Type: text/html
      Content-Language: en
      Link: <http://example.com/probs/out-of-credit>; rel="describedby";
               title="You do not have enough credits."; balance=30;
               account="http://api.example.com/account/12345"

   Here, the same problem as above is conveyed using the header in
   previous examples, but without the optional detail.

   Problem details are serialised into Link headers using the
   "describedby" link relation type, with the URL for the problem type
   as the link target.  The title is conveyed using the "title"
   parameter, and the detail can be conveyed using the "detail"
   parameter.

   Extension parameters on the JSON Object can also be expressed as
   target parameters on the link header, as long as the extension either
   defines them as a string, or explains how to express them as one.

   The title, detail, and extension properties MUST use the encoding
   specified in [RFC5987] if it falls outside of the US-ASCII character
   set.

   For example, the following are all valid:

      Link: <http://example.com/p/1>; rel="describedby"; title="Hi"
      Link: <ftp://example.com/p/1>; rel="describedby"; title="Hi"
      Link: <http://example.com/p/1>; rel="describedby";
            title="Hi there"; detail="something happened."
      Link: <http://example.com/p/1>; rel="describedby"; other="foo";
            title="Hi there"; title*=UTF-8''Hi%20there; another=bar;
            detail*=UTF-8''something%20happened


5.  Defining New Problem Details

   Before defining a new type of problem detail, it's important to
   understand what they are good for, and what's better left to other
   mechanisms.

   Problem details are not a debugging tool for the underlying
   implementation; rather, they are a way to expose greater detail about
   the HTTP interface of the application itself.

   For example, an "out of credit" problem is an appropriate explanation
   as to why a request was forbidden.  In contrast, a description of the
   internal conditions that led to a 500 Internal Server Error along

Internet-Draft               Problem Details                   July 2012


   with a stack trace are not an appropriate use of this mechanism,
   because it exposes implementation detail, rather than explaining the
   interface.

   At the other end of the spectrum, truly generic problems - i.e.,
   conditions that could potentially apply to any resource on the Web -
   are usually better expressed as plain status codes.

   For example, a "write access disallowed" problem is unnecessary,
   since a 403 Forbidden status code on a PUT request is self-
   explanatory.

   Finally, a problem domain may have a more appropriate way to carry an
   error in a format that it already defines.  Problem details are
   intended to avoid the necessity of establishing new "fault" or
   "error" document formats, not to replace existing domain-specific
   formats.  That said, it is possible to add support for problems using
   HTTP server-driven content negotiation (i.e., the client uses the
   Accept request header to indicate a preference for problems).

   If defining a new problem still seems wise, one can be created by:
   1.  Nominating a describedby URL (typically, with the "http" scheme),
   2.  Choosing a title that appropriately describes it (think short),
       and
   3.  Nominating a HTTP status code for it to be used with.

   Problem types MAY specify the use of the Retry-After response header
   in appropriate circumstances.

   A problem's describedby URL SHOULD resolve to HTML documentation that
   explains how to resolve the problem.

   Optionally, a problem definition MAY specify additional properties on
   the Problem Details JSON object.

   For example, an extension might use typed links [RFC5988] to another
   resource that can be used by machines to resolve the problem.

   If an extension is defined, its name SHOULD conform to token
   [RFC2616], so that it can be serialised in header and other formats.

   Likewise, problems defining extensions should either make their
   values strings, or explain how to map their values to strings that
   are safe to include in HTTP headers (noting the special semantics of
   a comma there).

6.  Generating Problem Details

   The URL used in the describedby property MUST NOT be changed in any
   way from that defined by its specification; doing so turns it into a
   different problem that most consumers will not recognise.

   The title string SHOULD be sent as specified by the problem
   definition, although it MAY be localised (e.g., using server-driven
   content negotiation, with the "Accept-Language" request header).
   Remember that such responses are required by HTTP to include a Vary
   header, e.g.:

      HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
      Content-Type: text/html
      Content-Language: se
      Vary: Accept-Language
      Link: <http://example.com/probs/out-of-credit>; rel="describedby";
               title*=UTF-8''Du%20%C3%A4r%20ute%20p%C3%A5%20pengar.

   Note the use of RFC5987 encoding here.  Problem details SHOULD be
   served with Content-Language headers, even if negotiation isn't used,
   to aid in localisation.

   The information conveyed in the detail property, if present, SHOULD
   focus on helping the client correct the problem, rather than giving
   debugging information.

   Software that generates problems should note that only one problem
   can be sent at at time.


7.  Consuming Problem Details

   Consumers should use the describedby URL as the primary identifier
   for the problem; the title string is advisory, and included only for
   users who are not aware of the semantics of the URL, and don't have
   the ability to discover them (e.g., offline log analysis).

   Likewise, the detail property SHOULD NOT be parsed for information by
   clients; extensions are more suitable and less error-prone ways to
   obtain such information.

   Clients consuming problem details MUST ignore unrecognised
   extensions; this allows problems to evolve and include additional
   information in the future.

   Finally, clients consuming problem details SHOULD NOT automatically
   deference the describedby URL; it is not intended for machine

   interaction.


8.  Security Considerations

   When defining a new problem, the information included must be
   carefully vetted.  Likewise, when actually generating a problem -
   however it is serialised - the details given must also be
   scrutinised.

   Risks include leaking information that can be exploited to compromise
   the system, access to the system, or the privacy of users of the
   system.


9.  IANA Considerations

   This specification defines a new Internet media type, "application/
   json-problem":

      Type name: application
      Subtype name: json-problem
      Required parameters: None
      Optional parameters: None; unrecognised parameters
                           should be ignored
      Encoding considerations: Same as [RFC4627]
      Security considerations: see [this document]
      Interoperability considerations: None.
      Published specification: [this document]
      Applications that use this media type: HTTP
      Additional information:
        Magic number(s): n/a
        File extension(s): n/a
        Macintosh file type code(s): n/a
      Person & email address to contact for further information:
