			<t>This specification proposes a "Problem Detail" as an extensible
         way to carry machine-readable details of HTTP errors in a response,
         to avoid the need to invent new response formats for non-human
         consumers.</t>

		</abstract>

      <note title="Note to Readers">
         
         <t>This specification is tentative (as all Internet-Drafts are, but
         even more so). It's not yet clear whether defining this format will
         improve things enough to balance out the harm it may cause, and so it
         may disappear at any time. Using it before it becomes an RFC may
         subject you to ridicule; you have been warned.</t>
            
         <t>What's the problem? In a nutshell, this sort of thing might
         encourage tighter coupling, making applications more brittle. On the
         other hand, lots of people are doing this already, so having a common
         way to do it -- with lots of caveats about how it can be misused --
         might be better. Stay tuned.</t>

		<section title="Introduction">

         <t>While HTTP <xref target="RFC2616"/> defines the status code as the
         primary indicator of response semantics, it is sometimes not
         fine-grained enough to convey helpful information about the error,
         particularly to non-human consumers.</t>

         <t>For example, consider a 403 Forbidden response that indicates that
         the client's account doesn't have enough credit. While this can be
         adequately expressed in HTML if it's presented to a human in front of
         a Web browser, a non-browser client will have difficulty
         understanding the response, because it doesn't understand the
         structure of the markup.</t>
         
         <t>This specification defines a "Problem Detail" as an
         extensible way to carry machine-readable details of errors in a
         response, to avoid the need to invent new response formats.</t>
         
          <t>Problem details have: 
             <list style="symbols">
             <t>A generic status, identified and solely conveyed by the HTTP
             status code <eref
             target="http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/"/>.
             For example, "403 Forbidden".</t>
             <t>An problem type that refines the status code semantics,
             identified by an absolute URI <xref target="RFC3986"/> and paired
             with a summary title.</t>
             <t>Optionally, detail that is specific to an instance
             of the problem.</t>
            </list>
         </t>
         
          <t>The common data model for problem details as a JSON <xref
          target="RFC4627"/> object. That object can be serialised as an
          "application/json-problem" HTTP response, or it can be conveyed
          using a Link HTTP response header field <xref
          target="RFC5988"/>.</t>
         
          <t>Future work may include defining a HTML Microformat <eref
          target="http://microformats.org/"/> that allows this information to
          be carried in an HTML document as well.</t>

          <t>Note that Problem Details are not the only way to convey the
             details of a problem in HTTP; if the response is still a
             representation of a resource, for example, it's often preferable
             to accommodate describing the details in that format.</t>
         
          <t>Rather, the aim of this specification is to define a common 
             format for those applications that need one, so that they
             aren't required to define their own.</t>

      <section title="The Problem Details JSON Object">

         <t>The canonical format for problem details is a JSON <xref
         target="RFC4627"/> document, identified with the
         "application/json-problem" media type. Its root object has the
         following properties:</t>
         
         <t><list style='symbols'>
            <t>"describedby" (string) - A URL that identifies the type of
            problem. When dereferenced, it SHOULD provide human-readable
            documentation (e.g., using HTML).</t>
            <t>"title" (string) - A short, human-readable summary of the
            problem. It SHOULD NOT change from instance to instance of the
            problem, except for purposes of localisation.</t>
            <t>"detail" (string) - Optionally, additional, human readable
            detail specific to this instance of the problem.</t>
         </list></t>
         
          <t>Problem details, when serialised as JSON objects, MUST
          include the "describedby" and "title" properties. The "detail"
          property is always OPTIONAL.</t>
         
          <t>Problem types MAY extend their instances with additional
          properties. For example:</t>

         <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
   HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
   Content-Type: application/json-problem
   Content-Language: en

   {
     "describedby": "http://example.com/probs/out-of-credit",
     "title": "You do not have enough credits.",
     "detail": "Your current balance is 30, but that costs 50.",
     "balance": 30,
     "account": "http://api.example.com/account/12345"
   }]]></artwork></figure>

         <t>Here, the out-of-credit problem (identified by its URI) indicates
         the reason for the 403 in "title", gives instance-specific
         details in "detail", and adds two extensions; "balance" conveys the
         account's balance, and "account" gives a link where the account can
         be topped up.</t>

         <t>Note that "describedby" is case-sensitive in the JSON object, as
            are all other property names.</t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="the-problem-http-response-header-field" title="Expressing Problem Details with Link Headers">

      <t>Because resources often use formats other than JSON to convey
      human-readable problem details, it is also possible to serialise Problem
      Details for non-browser consumption alongside them using a Link response
      header field <xref target="RFC5988"/>. For example:</t>

      <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
   HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
   Content-Type: text/html
   Content-Language: en
   Link: <http://example.com/probs/out-of-credit>; rel="describedby";
            title="You do not have enough credits."; balance=30;
            account="http://api.example.com/account/12345"
]]></artwork></figure>

      <t>Here, the same problem as above is conveyed using the header in
      previous examples, but without the optional detail.</t>

      <t>Problem details are serialised into Link headers using the
      "describedby" link relation type, with the URL for the problem type as
      the link target. The title is conveyed using the "title" parameter, 
      and the detail can be conveyed using the "detail" parameter.</t>
          
      <t>Extension parameters on the JSON Object can also be expressed as
      target parameters on the link header, as long as the extension either
      defines them as a string, or explains how to express them as one.</t>
       
      <t>The title, detail, and extension properties MUST use the encoding
      specified in <xref target="RFC5987"/> if it falls outside of the
      US-ASCII character set.</t>
      
      <t>For example, the following are all valid:</t>

      <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
   Link: <http://example.com/p/1>; rel="describedby"; title="Hi"
   Link: <ftp://example.com/p/1>; rel="describedby"; title="Hi"
   Link: <http://example.com/p/1>; rel="describedby";
         title="Hi there"; detail="something happened."
   Link: <http://example.com/p/1>; rel="describedby"; other="foo";
         title="Hi there"; title*=UTF-8''Hi%20there; another=bar;
         detail*=UTF-8''something%20happened
]]></artwork></figure>

      <section anchor="defining" title="Defining New Problem Details">

         <t>Before defining a new type of problem detail, it’s important to
         understand what they are good for, and what’s better left to other
         mechanisms.</t>
         
         <t>Problem details are not a debugging tool for the underlying
         implementation; rather, they are a way to expose greater detail about
         the HTTP interface of the application itself.</t>
         
         <t>For example, an "out of credit" problem is an appropriate
         explanation as to why a request was forbidden. In contrast, a
         description of the internal conditions that led to a 500 Internal
         Server Error along with a stack trace are not an appropriate use of
         this mechanism, because it exposes implementation detail, rather than
         explaining the interface.</t>
                  
         <t>At the other end of the spectrum, truly generic problems – i.e.,
         conditions that could potentially apply to any resource on the Web –
         are usually better expressed as plain status codes.</t>

         <t>For example, a "write access disallowed" problem is
         unnecessary, since a 403 Forbidden status code on a PUT request is
         self-explanatory.</t>
         
         <t>Finally, a problem domain may have a more appropriate way to carry
         an error in a format that it already defines. Problem details
         are intended to avoid the necessity of establishing new "fault" or
         "error" document formats, not to replace existing domain-specific
         formats. That said, it is possible to add support for problems using
         HTTP server-driven content negotiation (i.e., the client uses the
         Accept request header to indicate a preference for problems).</t>
		
         <t>If defining a new problem still seems wise, one can be created
         by:
         
         <list style="numbers">
            <t>Nominating a describedby URL (typically, with the "http"
            scheme),</t>
            <t>Choosing a title that appropriately describes it (think
            short), and</t>
            <t>Nominating a HTTP status code for it to be used with.</t>
         </list></t>
         
         <t>Problem types MAY specify the use of the Retry-After response
         header in appropriate circumstances.</t>
         
         <t>A problem’s describedby URL SHOULD resolve to HTML documentation
         that explains how to resolve the problem.</t>
         
         <t>Optionally, a problem definition MAY specify additional properties
         on the Problem Details JSON object.</t>
         
         <t>For example, an extension might use typed links <xref
         target="RFC5988"/> to another resource that can be used by machines
         to resolve the problem.</t>
         
         <t>If an extension is defined, its name SHOULD conform to token <xref
         target="RFC2616"/>, so that it can be serialised in header and other
         formats.</t>
         
         <t>Likewise, problems defining extensions should either make their
         values strings, or explain how to map their values to strings that
         are safe to include in HTTP headers (noting the special semantics of
         a comma there).</t>

         </section>
         
         <section anchor="generating-problems" title="Generating
         Problem Details">
         
          <t>The URL used in the describedby property MUST NOT be changed in
         any way from that defined by its specification; doing so turns it
         into a different problem that most consumers will not recognise.</t>
         
          <t>The title string SHOULD be sent as specified by the problem
         definition, although it MAY be localised (e.g., using server-driven
         content negotiation, with the "Accept-Language" request header).
         Remember that such responses are required by HTTP to include a Vary
         header, e.g.:</t>

      <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
   HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
   Content-Type: text/html
   Content-Language: se
   Vary: Accept-Language
   Link: <http://example.com/probs/out-of-credit>; 
         rel="describedby"; 
         title*=UTF-8''Du%20%C3%A4r%20ute%20p%C3%A5%20pengar.
]]></artwork></figure>

         <t>Note the use of RFC5987 encoding here. Problem details SHOULD be
         served with Content-Language headers, even if negotiation isn't
         used, to aid in localisation.</t>

         <t>The information conveyed in the detail property, if present,
         SHOULD focus on helping the client correct the problem, rather than
         giving debugging information.</t>

          <t>Software that generates problems should note that only one
         problem can be sent at at time. </t>
         

      </section>

      <section anchor="consuming-problems" title="Consuming Problem Details">

         <t>Consumers should use the describedby URL as the primary identifier
         for the problem; the title string is advisory, and included only for
         users who are not aware of the semantics of the URL, and don’t have
         the ability to discover them (e.g., offline log analysis).</t>
         
         <t>Likewise, the detail property SHOULD NOT be parsed for information
         by clients; extensions are more suitable and less error-prone ways to
         obtain such information.</t>

         <t>Clients consuming problem details MUST ignore unrecognised
         extensions; this allows problems to evolve and include additional
         information in the future. </t>

         <t>Finally, clients consuming problem details SHOULD NOT
         automatically deference the describedby URL; it is not intended for
         machine interaction.</t>

      </section>
            
		<section title="Security Considerations">

         <t>When defining a new problem, the information included must be
         carefully vetted. Likewise, when actually generating a problem –
         however it is serialised – the details given must also be
         scrutinised.</t>
         
          <t>Risks include leaking information that can be exploited to
         compromise the system, access to the system, or the privacy of
         users of the system.</t>
