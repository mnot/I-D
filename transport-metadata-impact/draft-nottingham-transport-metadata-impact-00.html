For examples, see <a href="#I-D.nottingham-gin"><cite title="Granular Information about Networks">[I-D.nottingham-gin]</cite></a>, <a href="#I-D.sprecher-mobile-tg-exposure-req-arch"><cite title="Requirements and reference architecture for Mobile Throughput Guidance Exposure">[I-D.sprecher-mobile-tg-exposure-req-arch]</cite></a> and <a href="#I-D.hildebrand-spud-prototype"><cite title="Substrate Protocol for User Datagrams (SPUD) Prototype">[I-D.hildebrand-spud-prototype]</cite></a>.</p><p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">These discussions are being at least partially motivated by the increasing use of encryption, both in deployment (thanks to the Snowden revelations) and standards (thanks in some part to <a href="#RFC7258"><cite title="Pervasive Monitoring Is an Attack">[RFC7258]</cite></a>, <a href="#IAB-confidentiality"><cite title="IAB Statement on Internet Confidentiality">[IAB-confidentiality]</cite></a>, and <a href="#TAG-securing-web"><cite title="Securing the Web">[TAG-securing-web]</cite></a>); while it’s becoming widely accepted that networks don’t have legitimate need to access the content of flows in most cases, they still wish to meet certain use cases that require more information.</p><p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">For example, networks may wish to communicate their state to applications, so that link limitations and transient problems can be accounted for in applications, by doing things like degrading (or improving) video streaming quality.</p><p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">Applications also need to give enough information to networks to enable proper function; e.g., packets in UDP flows need to be associated to be able to cleanly transit NAT and firewalls. See <a href="#I-D.trammell-stackevo-newtea"><cite title="Thoughts a New Transport Encapsulation Architecture">[I-D.trammell-stackevo-newtea]</cite></a> and <a href="#I-D.hardie-spud-use-cases"><cite title="Use Cases for SPUD">[I-D.hardie-spud-use-cases]</cite></a> for more discussion.</p><p id="rfc.section.1.p.5">At the same time, it has been widely noted that “metadata” in various forms can be profoundly sensitive information, particularly when aggregated into large sets over extensive periods of time.</p><p id="rfc.section.1.p.6">Indeed, much of the effort in combatting pervasive monitoring (as per <a href="#RFC7258"><cite title="Pervasive Monitoring Is an Attack">[RFC7258]</cite></a>) has focused on minimizing metadata in existing, known protocols (such as TLS and HTTP).</p><p id="rfc.section.1.p.7">Any new metadata facility, then – whether it be introduced to an existing protocol, or as part of a new one – needs to be carefully scrutinized and narrowly tailored to conservatively emit metadata.</p><p id="rfc.section.1.p.8">This draft attempts to identify potential impacts associated with new metadata facilities in Internet protocols, and suggest possible mitigations. Its goal is to initiate a discussion of these tradeoffs up-front, rather than waiting until after the development of such mechanisms.</p><p id="rfc.section.1.p.9">Adding metadata to protocols is not an inherent harm – i.e., there are some legitimate uses of metadata, particularly if it eases the adoption of encrypted protocols or aligns well with both the interests of users and service or network operations, e.g., traffic management on mobile networks. However, the balance between the interests of constituents like end users, content providers and network operators needs to be carefully considered.</p></div><div id="potential-impact"><h1 id="rfc.section.2">2.&nbsp;Potential Impact</h1><div id="security-and-privacy"><h2 id="rfc.section.2.1">2.1&nbsp;Security and Privacy</h2><p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.1">It’s been established <a href="#Injection"><cite title="The Rise of Mobile Tracking Headers: How Telcos Around the World Are Threatening Your Privacy">[Injection]</cite></a> that many network operators inject HTTP headers into requests, in order to identify their customers using a unique identifier, thereby allowing “third-party advertisers and websites to assemble a deep, permanent profile of visitors’ web browsing habits without their consent.” <a href="#X-UIDH"><cite title="Verizon Injecting Perma-Cookies to Track Mobile Customers, Bypassing Privacy Controls">[X-UIDH]</cite></a></p><p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.2">In doing so, these networks are taking advantage of a relatively unconstrained extension point in the HTTP protocol – header fields. While HTTP header fields do require registration <a href="#RFC3864"><cite title="Registration Procedures for Message Header Fields">[RFC3864]</cite></a>, the requirements are lax, and fields are often used without registration, because there is no technical enforcement of the requirements, due to HTTP’s policy of ignoring unrecognized header fields <a href="#RFC7230"><cite title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing">[RFC7230]</cite></a>.</p><p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.3">HTTP header fields can be made a protected end-to-end facility by using HTTPS, avoiding the risk of such injection. A new transport metadata facility that explicitly allows any node on the path to add arbitrary metadata cannot.</p><p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.4">Well-intentioned metadata can also put the user at substantial risk without careful consideration. For example, if a Web browser “labels” flows based upon what they contain (e.g., “video”, “image”, “interactive”), an observer on the network path – including pervasive ones – can more effectively perform traffic analysis to determine what the user is doing. Similarly, metadata adornment might reveal sensitive information; for example the Server Name Indicator (SNI) in the TLS handshake would reveal if a web visitor intends to go to <samp>bannedcontent.github.com</samp> versus <samp>kitties.github.com</samp>.</p><p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.5">Standardizing an extensible transport metadata mechanism could also trigger various jurisdictions to define and require insertion of in-band metadata, an extension of current practices <a href="#AU-data-retention"><cite title="Your guide to the data retention debate: what it is and why it’s bad">[AU-data-retention]</cite></a>. While the IETF would not be directly responsible for such an outcome, it is notable that in the past we’ve explicitly said we won’t serve conceptually similar use cases <a href="#RFC1984"><cite title="IAB and IESG Statement on Cryptographic Technology and the Internet">[RFC1984]</cite></a>.</p></div><div id="network-neutrality"><h2 id="rfc.section.2.2">2.2&nbsp;Network Neutrality</h2><p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.1">There is obvious potential for network neutrality impact from a mechanism that allows networks to communicate with endpoints about flows.</p><p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.2">For example, if a network can instruct content servers to throttle back bandwidth available to users for video based upon a commercial arrangement (or lack thereof), the network can achieve their goals without directly throttling traffic, thereby offering the potential to circumvent a regulatory regime that’s designed to effect network neutrality.</p><p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.3">While the IETF has not take as firm a stance on network neutrality as it has for Pervasive Monitoring (for good reasons, since network neutrality problems are at their heart a sign of market failure, not a technical issue), new metadata facilities that enable existing regulatory regimes – thereby upsetting “the tussle” – must be carefully considered.</p></div></div><div id="possible-mitigations"><h1 id="rfc.section.3">3.&nbsp;Possible Mitigations</h1><div id="constrained-vocabulary"><h2 id="rfc.section.3.1">3.1&nbsp;Constrained Vocabulary</h2><p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.1">Much of the potential for harm above comes about because a transport-level metadata mechanism effectively becomes a side channel for arbitrary data, for use by any node on the path. The risks of questionable use could be mitigated by constraining the data that’s allowed in this side channel.</p><p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.2">In other words, if the network doesn’t have a means of inserting a unique identifier for customers, they won’t be able to do so. If notification of constrained network conditions takes place using well-defined terms, regulatory regimes can be adjusted to achieve desired outcomes. And, information about application semantics can be carefully vetted for security considerations before being included in transport metadata.</p><p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.3">One way to technically enforce such constraints would be to require nodes to silently drop non-standard metadata. Another would be to not make metadata extensible at all.</p><p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.4">Naturally, this would constrain the ability of networks and applications to add new terms to metadata, thereby requiring more careful thought to go into the metadata that is standardised “up front.”</p></div><div id="transparency"><h2 id="rfc.section.3.2">3.2&nbsp;Transparency</h2><p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.1">Many proposals for transport metadata assert that it will be encrypted, to improve security. While well-intentioned, it also creates an opaque side channel with a third party (the first and second being the endpoints).</p><p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.2">The effect of of such designs should be carefully considered before standardisation; it may be that the community is better served by keeping this metadata “in the clear”, albeit possibly with some form of authentication and integrity available (or required).</p></div></div><div id="security-considerations"><h1 id="rfc.section.4">4.&nbsp;Security Considerations</h1><p id="rfc.section.4.p.1">This document describes security and privacy aspects of metadata adornment to internet protocols that protocol designers should consider.</p></div><h1 id="rfc.references"><a href="#rfc.section.5" id="rfc.section.5">5.</a> Informative References</h1><dl class="dl-horizontal"><dt><span id="AU-data-retention">[AU-data-retention]</span></dt><dd>Keane, B., “<a href="http://www.crikey.com.au/2015/03/18/your-guide-to-the-data-retention-debate-what-it-is-and-why-it%E2%80%99s-bad/">Your guide to the data retention debate: what it is and why it’s bad</a>”, March&nbsp;2015, &lt;<a href="http://www.crikey.com.au/2015/03/18/your-guide-to-the-data-retention-debate-what-it-is-and-why-it%E2%80%99s-bad/">http://www.crikey.com.au/2015/03/18/your-guide-to-the-data-retention-debate-what-it-is-and-why-it’s-bad/</a>&gt;.</dd><dt><span id="I-D.hardie-spud-use-cases">[I-D.hardie-spud-use-cases]</span></dt><dd>Hardie, T., “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hardie-spud-use-cases-01">Use Cases for SPUD</a>”, Internet-Draft&nbsp;draft-hardie-spud-use-cases-01 (work in progress), February&nbsp;2015.</dd><dt><span id="I-D.hildebrand-spud-prototype">[I-D.hildebrand-spud-prototype]</span></dt><dd>Hildebrand, J. and B.
