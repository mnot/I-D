1.  Introduction

   Recently, there has been an increasing amount of discussion in the
   IETF about adorning protocol flows with metadata about the network's
   state for consumption by applications, as well as that of the
   application in order to inform decisions in the network.  For
   examples, see [I-D.nottingham-gin],
   [I-D.sprecher-mobile-tg-exposure-req-arch] and
   [I-D.hildebrand-spud-prototype].

   These discussions are being at least partially motivated by the
   increasing use of encryption, both in deployment (thanks to the
   Snowden revelations) and standards (thanks in some part to [RFC7258],
   [IAB-confidentiality], and [TAG-securing-web]); while it's becoming
   widely accepted that networks don't have legitimate need to access
   the content of flows in most cases, they still wish to meet certain
   use cases that require more information.

   For example, networks may wish to communicate their state to
   applications, so that link limitations and transient problems can be
   accounted for in applications, by doing things like degrading (or
   improving) video streaming quality.

   Applications also need to give enough information to networks to
   enable proper function; e.g., packets in UDP flows need to be
   associated to be able to cleanly transit NAT and firewalls.  See
   [I-D.trammell-stackevo-newtea] and [I-D.hardie-spud-use-cases] for
   more discussion.

   At the same time, it has been widely noted that "metadata" in various
   forms can be profoundly sensitive information, particularly when
   aggregated into large sets over extensive periods of time.

   Indeed, much of the effort in combatting pervasive monitoring (as per
   [RFC7258]) has focused on minimizing metadata in existing, known
   protocols (such as TLS and HTTP).

   Any new metadata facility, then - whether it be introduced to an
   existing protocol, or as part of a new one - needs to be carefully
   scrutinized and narrowly tailored to conservatively emit metadata.

   This draft attempts to identify potential impacts associated with new
   metadata facilities in Internet protocols, and suggest possible
   mitigations.  Its goal is to initiate a discussion of these tradeoffs
   up-front, rather than waiting until after the development of such
   mechanisms.

   Adding metadata to protocols is not an inherent harm - i.e., there
   are some legitimate uses of metadata, particularly if it eases the
   adoption of encrypted protocols or aligns well with both the
   interests of users and service or network operations, e.g., traffic
   management on mobile networks.  However, the balance between the
   interests of constituents like end users, content providers and
   network operators needs to be carefully considered.

2.  Potential Impact

2.1.  Security and Privacy

   It's been established [Injection] that many network operators inject
   HTTP headers into requests, in order to identify their customers
   using a unique identifier, thereby allowing "third-party advertisers
   and websites to assemble a deep, permanent profile of visitors' web
   browsing habits without their consent."  [X-UIDH]

   In doing so, these networks are taking advantage of a relatively
   unconstrained extension point in the HTTP protocol - header fields.
   While HTTP header fields do require registration [RFC3864], the
   requirements are lax, and fields are often used without registration,
   because there is no technical enforcement of the requirements, due to
   HTTP's policy of ignoring unrecognized header fields [RFC7230].

   HTTP header fields can be made a protected end-to-end facility by
   using HTTPS, avoiding the risk of such injection.  A new transport
   metadata facility that explicitly allows any node on the path to add
   arbitrary metadata cannot.

   Well-intentioned metadata can also put the user at substantial risk
   without careful consideration.  For example, if a Web browser
   "labels" flows based upon what they contain (e.g., "video", "image",
   "interactive"), an observer on the network path - including pervasive
   ones - can more effectively perform traffic analysis to determine
   what the user is doing.  Similarly, metadata adornment might reveal
   sensitive information; for example the Server Name Indicator (SNI) in
   the TLS handshake would reveal if a web visitor intends to go to
   "bannedcontent.github.com" versus "kitties.github.com".

   Standardizing an extensible transport metadata mechanism could also
   trigger various jurisdictions to define and require insertion of in-
   band metadata, an extension of current practices [AU-data-retention].
   While the IETF would not be directly responsible for such an outcome,
   it is notable that in the past we've explicitly said we won't serve
   conceptually similar use cases [RFC1984].

2.2.  Network Neutrality

   There is obvious potential for network neutrality impact from a
   mechanism that allows networks to communicate with endpoints about
   flows.

   For example, if a network can instruct content servers to throttle
   back bandwidth available to users for video based upon a commercial
   arrangement (or lack thereof), the network can achieve their goals
   without directly throttling traffic, thereby offering the potential
   to circumvent a regulatory regime that's designed to effect network
   neutrality.

   While the IETF has not take as firm a stance on network neutrality as
   it has for Pervasive Monitoring (for good reasons, since network
   neutrality problems are at their heart a sign of market failure, not
   a technical issue), new metadata facilities that enable existing
   regulatory regimes - thereby upsetting "the tussle" - must be
   carefully considered.

3.  Possible Mitigations

3.1.  Constrained Vocabulary

   Much of the potential for harm above comes about because a transport-
   level metadata mechanism effectively becomes a side channel for
   arbitrary data, for use by any node on the path.  The risks of
   questionable use could be mitigated by constraining the data that's
   allowed in this side channel.

Internet-Draft          Transport Metadata Impact            August 2015


   In other words, if the network doesn't have a means of inserting a
   unique identifier for customers, they won't be able to do so.  If
   notification of constrained network conditions takes place using
   well-defined terms, regulatory regimes can be adjusted to achieve
   desired outcomes.  And, information about application semantics can
   be carefully vetted for security considerations before being included
   in transport metadata.

   One way to technically enforce such constraints would be to require
   nodes to silently drop non-standard metadata.  Another would be to
   not make metadata extensible at all.

   Naturally, this would constrain the ability of networks and
   applications to add new terms to metadata, thereby requiring more
   careful thought to go into the metadata that is standardised "up
   front."

3.2.  Transparency

   Many proposals for transport metadata assert that it will be
   encrypted, to improve security.  While well-intentioned, it also
   creates an opaque side channel with a third party (the first and
   second being the endpoints).

   The effect of of such designs should be carefully considered before
   standardisation; it may be that the community is better served by
   keeping this metadata "in the clear", albeit possibly with some form
   of authentication and integrity available (or required).

4.  Security Considerations

   This document describes security and privacy aspects of metadata
   adornment to internet protocols that protocol designers should
   consider.
