    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-httpbis-http2"/> specifies a few ways to negotiate the use of
HTTP/2.0 without changing existing URIs. However, several deficiencies in using
the “upgrade dance” for “http://” URIs have become apparent. While that
mechanism is still being investigated, some have expressed interest in an
alternate approach.</t>
      <t>Furthermore, some implementers have expressed a strong desire utilize HTTP/2
only in conjunction with TLS. Alternate-Services provides a potential mechanism
for achieving that for “http://” URIs; see <xref target="I-D.nottingham-http2-encryption"/>
for details.</t>
      <t>Finally, HTTP/2.0 is designed to have longer-lived, fewer and more active TCP
connections. While these properties are generally “friendlier” for the network,
they can cause problems for servers that currently exploit the short-lived flow
characteristics of HTTP/1.x for load balancing, session affinity and
maintaining locality to the user.</t>
      <t>This document specifies a new concept in HTTP, the “alternate service,” to
address these use cases. An alternate service can be used to interact with the
resources on an origin server at a separate location on the network, possibly
using a different protocol configuration.</t>

        <t>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”,
“SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be
interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
        <t>This document uses the Augmented BNF defined in <xref target="RFC5234"/> along with the
“OWS”, “DIGIT”, “parameter”, “uri-host”, “port” and “delta-second” rules from
<xref target="I-D.ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging"/>, and uses the “#rule” extension defined in
Section 7 of that document.</t>

    <section anchor="alternate-services" title="Alternate Services">
      <t>On the Web, a resource is accessed through a scheme (e.g., “https” or “http”)
on a nominated host / port combination.</t>
      <t>These three pieces of information collectively can be used to establish the
authority for ownership of the resource (its “origin”; see <xref target="RFC6454"/>), as
well as providing enough information to bootstrap access to it.</t>
      <t>This document introduces the notion of an “Alternate Service”; when an
origin’s resources are accessible through a different protocol / host / port
combination, it is said to have an alternate service.</t>
      <t>For example, an origin:</t>
      <figure>
        <artwork><![CDATA[
("http", "www.example.com", "80")
]]></artwork>
      </figure>
      <t>might declare that its resources are also accessible at the alternate service:</t>
      <figure>
        <artwork><![CDATA[
("http2-tls", "new.example.com", "443")
]]></artwork>
      </figure>
      <t>By their nature, alternate services are explicitly at the granularity of an
origin; i.e., they cannot be selectively applied to resources within an origin.</t>
      <t>Alternate services do not replace or change the origin for any given resource;
in general, they are not visible to the software “above” the access mechanism.
The alternate service is essentially alternate routing information that can
also be used to reach the origin in the same way that DNS CNAME or SRV records
define routing information at the name resolution level.</t>
      <t>Furthermore, it is important to note that the first member of an alternate
service tuple is different from the “scheme” component of an origin; it is more
specific, identifying not only the major version of the protocol being used,
but potentially communication options for that protocol.</t>
      <t>This means that clients using an alternate service will change the host, port
and protocol that they are using to fetch resources, but these changes MUST NOT
be propagated to the application that is using HTTP; from that standpoint, the
URI being accessed and all information derived from it (scheme, host, port) are
the same as before.</t>
      <t>Importantly, this includes its security context; in particular, when TLS
<xref target="RFC5246"/> is in use, the alternate server will need to present a certificate
for the origin’s host name, not that of the alternate. Likewise, the Host
header is still derived from the origin, not the alternate service (just as it
would if a CNAME were being used).</t>
      <t>The changes MAY, however, be made visible in debugging tools, consoles, etc.</t>
      <t>Formally, an alternate service is identified by the combination of:</t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>An ALPN protocol, as per <xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-applayerprotoneg"/></t>
          <t>A host, as per <xref target="RFC3986"/></t>
          <t>A port, as per <xref target="RFC3986"/></t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>Additionally, each alternate service MUST have:</t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>A freshness lifetime, expressed in seconds; see <xref target="caching"/></t>
          <t>A numeric priority; see <xref target="priority"/></t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>Potentially, there are many ways that a client could discover the alternate
service(s) associated with an origin; this document currently defines one, the
Alt-Svc HTTP Header Field (<xref target="alt-svc"/>).</t>
      <section anchor="client-handling-for-alternate-services" title="Client Handling for Alternate Services">
        <section anchor="host_auth" title="Host Authentication">
          <t>Clients MUST NOT use alternate services with a host other than the origin’s
without strong server authentication; this mitigates the attack described in
<xref target="host_security"/>. One way to achieve this is for the alternate to use TLS with
a certificate that is valid for that origin.</t>
          <t>For example, if the origin’s host is “www.example.com” and an alternate is
offered on “other.example.com” with the “http2-tls” protocol, and the
certificate offered is valid for “www.example.com”, the client can use the
alternate. However, if “other.example.com” is offered with the “http2”
protocol, the client cannot use it, because there is no mechanism in that
protocol to establish strong server authentication.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="caching" title="Alternate Service Caching">
          <t>Mechanisms for discovering alternate services can associate a freshness
lifetime with them; for example, the Alt-Svc header field uses the “ma”
parameter.</t>
          <t>Clients MAY choose to use an alternate service instead of the origin at any
time when it is considered fresh; see <xref target="switching"/> for specific
recommendations. </t>
          <t>To mitigate risks associated with caching compromised values (see
<xref target="host_security"/> for details), user agents SHOULD examine cached alternate
services when they detect a change in network configuration, and remove any
that could be compromised (for example, those whose association with the trust
root is questionable). UAs that do not have a means of detecting network
changes SHOULD place an upper bound on their lifetime.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="priority" title="Alternate Service Priorities">
          <t>Mechanisms for discovering alternate services can associate a priority with
them; for example, the Alt-Svc header field uses the “pr” parameter.</t>
          <t>Priorities are numeric, with a range of 1-64, and are relative to the origin
server, which has a static priority of 32. Higher values are preferable.</t>
          <t>Therefore, an alternate with a priority of 48 will be used in preference to the
origin server, whereas one with a priority of 10 will be used only when the
origin server becomes unavailable.</t>
          <t>Note that priorities are not specific to the mechanism that an alternate was
discovered with; i.e., there is only one “pool” of priorities for an origin.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="requiring-server-name-indication" title="Requiring Server Name Indication">
          <t>A client must only use a TLS based alternate service if the client also
supports TLS Server Name Indication (SNI) <xref target="RFC6066"/>. This supports the
conservation of IP addresses on the alternate service host.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="switching" title="Using Alternate Services">
          <t>By their nature, alternate services are optional; clients are not required to
use them. However, it is advantageous for clients to behave in a predictable
way when they are used by servers (e.g., for load balancing).</t>
          <t>Therefore, if a client becomes aware of an alternate service that has a higher
priority than a connection currently in use, the client SHOULD use that
alternate service as soon as it is available, provided that the security
properties of the alternate service protocol are desirable, as compared to the
existing connection.</t>
          <t>For example, if an origin advertises a “http2-tls” alternate service using an
“Alt-Svc” response header field, the client ought to immediately establish a
connection to the most preferable alternate service, and use it in preference
to the origin connection once available. </t>
          <t>The client is not required to block requests; the origin’s connection can be
used until the alternate connection is established. However, if the security
properties of the existing connection are weak (e.g. cleartext HTTP/1.1) then
it might make sense to block until the new connection is fully available in
order to avoid information leakage.</t>
          <t>Furthermore, if the connection to the alternate service fails or is
unresponsive, the client MAY fall back to using the origin, or a less
preferable alternate service.</t>

      </section>
    </section>
    <section anchor="alt-svc" title="The Alt-Svc HTTP Header Field">
      <t>A HTTP(S) origin server can advertise the availability of alternate services to
clients by adding an Alt-Svc header field to responses.</t>
      <figure>
        <artwork><![CDATA[
Alt-Svc     = 1#( alternate *( OWS ";" OWS parameter ) )
alternate   = protocol-id "=" [ uri-host ] ":" port
protocol-id = <ALPN protocol identifier>
]]></artwork>
      </figure>
      <t>For example:</t>
      <figure>
        <artwork><![CDATA[
Alt-Svc: http2=:8000
]]></artwork>
      </figure>
      <t>This indicates that the “http2” protocol on the same host using the
indicated port (in this case, 8000).</t>
      <t>Alt-Svc can also contain a host:</t>
      <figure>
        <artwork><![CDATA[
Alt-Svc: http2-tls=other.example.com:443
]]></artwork>
      </figure>
      <t>This indicates that all resources on the origin are available using the
“http2-tls” profile on other.example.com port 443.</t>
      <t>It can also have multiple values:</t>
      <figure>
        <artwork><![CDATA[
Alt-Svc: http2=:8000, http2-tls=other.example.com:443
]]></artwork>
      </figure>
      <t>The value(s) advertised by Alt-Svc can be used by clients to open a new
connection to one or more alternate services immediately, or simultaneously
with subsequent requests on the same connection.</t>
      <t>Intermediaries MUST NOT change or append Alt-Svc values. </t>
      <section anchor="caching-alt-svc-header-field-values" title="Caching Alt-Svc Header Field Values">
        <t>When an alternate service is advertised using Alt-Svc, it is considered fresh
for 24 hours from generation of the message. This can be modified with the ‘ma’
(max-age’) parameter;</t>
        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
Alt-Svc: http2-tls=:443;ma=3600
]]></artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>which indicates the number of seconds since the response was generated the
alternate service is considered fresh for. </t>
        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
ma = delta-seconds
]]></artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>See <xref target="I-D.ietf-httpbis-p6-cache"/> Section 4.2.3 for details of determining
response age. For example, a response:</t>
        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Cache-Control: 600
Age: 30
Alt-Svc: http2=:8000; ma=60
]]></artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>indicates that an alternate service is available and usable for the next 60
seconds. However, the response has already been cached for 30 seconds (as per
the Age header field value), so therefore the alternate service is only fresh
for the 30 seconds from when this response was received, minus estimated
transit time. </t>
        <t>When an Alt-Svc response header is received from an origin, its value
invalidates and replaces all cached alternate services for that origin. This
includes the empty Alt-Svc header, which clears all cached alternate services
for an origin.</t>
        <t>See <xref target="caching"/> for general requirements on caching alternate services.</t>
        <t>Note that the freshness lifetime for HTTP caching (here, 600 seconds) does not
affect caching of Alt-Svc values.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="indicating-alt-svc-header-field-priority" title="Indicating Alt-Svc Header Field Priority">
        <t>Finally, an explicit priority can be associated with an Alt-Svc header field
value by using the “pr” parameter:</t>
        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
Alt-Svc: http2-tls:8000 ;pr=64
]]></artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>See <xref target="priority"/> for details of the priority mechanism. </t>
        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
pr = 1*2DIGIT
]]></artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>If the “pr” parameter is not present or is invalid, the default priority for
alternate services discovered with the Alt-Svc header field is 48.</t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations">
      <section anchor="changing-ports" title="Changing Ports">
        <t>Using an alternate service implies accessing an origin’s resources on an
alternate port, at a minimum. An attacker that can inject alternate services
and listen at the advertised port is therefore able to hijack an origin.</t>
        <t>For example, an attacker that can add HTTP response header fields can redirect
traffic to a different port on the same host using the Alt-Svc header field; if
that port is under the attacker’s control, they can thus masquerade as the HTTP
server.</t>
        <t>This risk can be mitigated by restricting the ability to set the Alt-Svc
response header field on the origin, and restricting who can open a port for
listening on that host.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="host_security" title="Changing Hosts">
        <t>When the host is changed due to the use of an alternate service, it presents an
opportunity for attackers to hijack communication to an origin.</t>
        <t>For example, if an attacker can convince a user agent to send all traffic for
“innocent.example.org” to “evil.example.com” by successfully associating it as
an alternate service, they can masquerade as that origin. This can be done
locally (see mitigations above) or remotely (e.g., by an intermediary as a
man-in-the-middle attack).</t>
        <t>This is the reason for the requirement in <xref target="host_auth"/> that any alternate
service with a host different to the origin’s be strongly authenticated with
the origin’s identity; i.e., presenting a certificate for the origin proves
that the alternate service is authorized to serve traffic for the origin.</t>
        <t>However, this authorization is only as strong as the method used to
authenticate the alternate service. In particular, there are well-known
exploits to make an attacker’s certificate appear as legitimate.</t>
        <t>Alternate services could be used to persist such an attack; for example, an
intermediary could man-in-the-middle TLS-protected communication to a target,
and then direct all traffic to an alternate service with a large freshness
lifetime, so that the user agent still directs traffic to the attacker even when
not using the intermediary.</t>
        <t>As a result, there is a requirement in <xref target="caching"/> to examine cached alternate
services when a network change is detected.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="changing-protocols" title="Changing Protocols">
        <t>When the ALPN protocol is changed due to the use of an alternate service, the
security properties of the new connection to the origin can be different from
that of the “normal” connection to the origin, because the protocol identifier
itself implies this.</t>
        <t>For example, if a “https://” URI had a protocol advertised that does not use
some form of end-to-end encryption (most likely, TLS), it violates the
expectations for security that the URI scheme implies.</t>
        <t>Therefore, clients cannot blindly use alternate services, but instead evaluate
the option(s) presented to assure that security requirements and expectations
(of specifications, implementations and end users) are met.</t>

            <t>
A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact sequence of characters
that identifies an abstract or physical resource.  This specification
defines the generic URI syntax and a process for resolving URI references
that might be in relative form, along with guidelines and security
considerations for the use of URIs on the Internet.
The URI syntax defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid URIs,
allowing an implementation to parse the common components of a URI
reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every
possible identifier.  This specification does not define a generative
grammar for URIs; that task is performed by the individual
specifications of each URI scheme.

          <abstract>
            <t>Internet technical specifications often need to define a formal syntax.  Over the years, a modified version of Backus-Naur Form (BNF), called Augmented BNF (ABNF), has been popular among many Internet specifications.  The current specification documents ABNF.  It balances compactness and simplicity with reasonable representational power.  The differences between standard BNF and ABNF involve naming rules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges.  This specification also supplies additional rule definitions and encoding for a core lexical analyzer of the type common to several Internet specifications. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

            <t>This document defines the concept of an "origin", which is often used as the scope of authority or privilege by user agents.  Typically, user agents isolate content retrieved from different origins to prevent malicious web site operators from interfering with the operation of benign web sites.  In addition to outlining the principles that underlie the concept of origin, this document details how to determine the origin of a URI and how to serialize an origin into a string.  It also defines an HTTP header field, named "Origin", that indicates which origins are associated with an HTTP request. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

            <t>This specification describes an optimized expression of the syntax of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).  HTTP/2.0 enables a more efficient use of network resources and a reduced perception of latency by introducing header field compression and allowing multiple concurrent messages on the same connection.  It also introduces unsolicited push of representations from servers to clients.  This document is an alternative to, but does not obsolete, the HTTP/1.1 message syntax.  HTTP's existing semantics remain unchanged.  This version of the draft has been marked for implementation. Interoperability testing will occur in the HTTP/2.0 interim in Zurich, CH, starting 2014-01-22.</t>
