<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>Some applications on the Web require the discovery of information about an origin <xref target="RFC6454"/>
(sometimes called “site-wide metadata”) before making a request. For example, the Robots Exclusion
Protocol (<eref target="http://www.robotstxt.org/">http://www.robotstxt.org/</eref>) specifies a way for automated processes to obtain permission
to access resources; likewise, the Platform for Privacy Preferences <xref target="W3C.REC-P3P-20020416"/> tells
user-agents how to discover privacy policy before interacting with an origin server.</t>

<t>While there are several ways to access per-resource metadata (e.g., HTTP headers, WebDAV’s PROPFIND
<xref target="RFC4918"/>), the perceived overhead (either in terms of client-perceived latency and/or
deployment difficulties) associated with them often precludes their use in these scenarios.</t>

<t>When this happens, one solution is designating a “well-known location” for data or services related
to the origin overall, so that it can be easily located. However, this approach has the drawback of
risking collisions, both with other such designated “well-known locations” and with
resources that the origin has created (or wishes to create).</t>

<t>To address this, this memo defines a path prefix in HTTP(S) URIs for these “well-known locations”,
“/.well-known/”. Future specifications that need to define a resource for such metadata can
register their use to avoid collisions and minimise impingement upon origins’ URI space.</t>

<t>Well-known URIs can also be used with other URI schemes, but only when those schemes’
definitions explicitly allow it.</t>

<section anchor="appropriate" title="Appropriate Use of Well-Known URIs">

<t>As per <xref target="RFC7320"/>, “publishing independent standards that mandate particular forms of URI
substructure is inappropriate, because that essentially usurps ownership.” Well-known URIs are not
an escape hatch from the requirements therein; they are a very limited carve-out of the path name
space owned by the authority, ceded to standard use for a designated purpose.</t>

<t>That purpose is to facilitate discovery of information about an origin when it isn’t practical to
use other mechanisms; for example, when discovering policy that needs to be evaluated before a
resource is accessed, or when the information applies to many (or all) of the origin’s resources.</t>

<t>Typically, the resource(s) identified by a well-known URI will make information about the origin
(e.g., policy) available directly, or provide references to other URIs that provide it. In general,
that information should be applicable to most origins (i.e., Web sites – while acknowledging that
some origins might not use a particular well-known location, for various reasons).</t>

<t>In keeping with the Architecture of the World-Wide Web <xref target="W3C.REC-webarch-20041215"/>, well-known
URIs are not intended for general information retrieval or establishment of large URI namespaces.</t>

<t>Specifically, well-known URIs are not a “protocol registry” for applications and protocols that
wish to use HTTP as a substrate. Instead, such applications and protocols are encouraged to used an
absolute URI to bootstrap their operation, rather than using a hostname and a well-known URI.</t>

<t>Exceptionally, the registry expert(s) may approve such a registration for documents in the IETF
Stream <xref target="RFC5741"/>, in consultation with the IESG, provided that the protocol in question cannot
be bootstrapped with a URI (e.g., the discovery mechanism can only carry a hostname). However,
merely making it easier to locate it is not a sufficient reason. Likewise, future use unsupported
by the specification in question is not sufficient reason to register a well-known location.</t>

<t>Well-known locations are also not suited for information on topics other than the origin that they
are located upon; for example, creating a well-known resource about a business entity or
organisational structure presumes that Internet hosts and organisations share structure, and are
likely to have significant deployment issues in environments where this is not true.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="notational-conventions" title="Notational Conventions">

<t>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”,
“RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
2119 <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="well-known" title="Well-Known URIs">

<t>A well-known URI is a URI <xref target="RFC3986"/> whose path component begins with the characters
“/.well-known/”, and whose scheme is “HTTP”, “HTTPS”, or another scheme that has explicitly been
specified to use well-known URIs.</t>

<t>Applications that wish to mint new well-known URIs MUST register them, following the procedures in
Section 5.1.</t>

<t>For example, if an application registers the name ‘example’, the corresponding well-known URI on
‘http://www.example.com/’ would be ‘http://www.example.com/.well-known/example’.</t>

<t>Registered names MUST conform to the segment-nz production in <xref target="RFC3986"/>. This means they cannot contain the “/” character.</t>

<t>Note that this specification defines neither how to determine the authority to use for a particular
context, nor the scope of the metadata discovered by dereferencing the well-known URI; both should
be defined by the application itself.</t>

<t>Typically, a registration will reference a specification that defines the format and associated
media type to be obtained by dereferencing the well-known URI.</t>

<t>It MAY also contain additional information, such as the syntax of additional path components, query
strings and/or fragment identifiers to be appended to the well-known URI, or protocol-specific
details (e.g., HTTP <xref target="RFC7231"/> method handling).</t>

<t>Note that this specification does not define a format or media-type for the resource located at
“/.well-known/” and clients should not expect a resource to exist at that location.</t>

<t>Well-known URIs are only valid when rooted in the top of the path’s hierarchy; they MUST NOT be used
in other parts of the path. For example, “/.well-known/example” is a valid use, but
“/foo/.well-known/example” is not.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations">

<t>This memo does not specify the scope of applicability of metadata or policy obtained from a
well-known URI, and does not specify how to discover a well-known URI for a particular application.
Individual applications using this mechanism must define both aspects.</t>

<t>Applications minting new well-known URIs, as well as administrators deploying them, will need to
consider several security-related issues, including (but not limited to) exposure of sensitive
data, denial-of-service attacks (in addition to normal load issues), server and client
authentication, vulnerability to DNS rebinding attacks, and attacks where limited access to a
server grants the ability to affect how well-known URIs are served.</t>

<t>Security-sensitive applications using well-known locations should consider that some server
administrators might be unaware of its existence (especially on operating systems that hide
directories whose names begin with “.”). This means that if an attacker has write access to the
.well-known directory, they would be able to control its contents, possibly without the
administrator realising it.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="iana-considerations" title="IANA Considerations">

<section anchor="the-well-known-uri-registry" title="The Well-Known URI Registry">

<t>This document specifies procedures for the well-known URI registry, first defined in <xref target="RFC5785"/>.</t>

<t>Well-known URIs are registered on the advice of one or more experts (appointed by the
IESG or their delegate), with a Specification Required (using terminology from <xref target="RFC8126"/>).</t>

<t>To allow for the allocation of values prior to publication, the expert(s) may
approve registration once they are satisfied that such a specification will be published.</t>

<t>Registration requests can be sent to the wellknown-uri-review@ietf.org mailing list for review
and comment, with an appropriate subject (e.g., “Request for well-known URI: example”).</t>

<section anchor="registration-template" title="Registration Template">

<section anchor="frequently-asked-questions" title="Frequently Asked Questions">

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>Aren’t well-known locations bad for the Web?  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
They are, but for various reasons – both technical and social – they are sometimes necessary. This memo defines a “sandbox” for them, to reduce the risks of collision
and to minimise the impact upon pre-existing URIs on sites.</t>
  <t>Why /.well-known?  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
It’s short, descriptive, and according to search indices, not widely used.</t>
  <t>What impact does this have on existing mechanisms, such as P3P and robots.txt?  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
None, until they choose to use this mechanism.</t>
  <t>Why aren’t per-directory well-known locations defined?  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
Allowing every URI path segment to have a well-known location (e.g., “/images/.well-known/”)
would increase the risks of colliding with a pre-existing URI on a site, and generally these
solutions are found not to scale well, because they’re too “chatty”.</t>
  <t>I want to use a well-known location to make it easy to configure my protocol that uses HTTP.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
This is not what well-known locations are for; see <xref target="appropriate"/>.</t>
