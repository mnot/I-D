<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>Some applications on the Web require the discovery of information about an origin <xref target="RFC6454"/>
(sometimes called “site-wide metadata”) before making a request. For example, the Robots Exclusion
Protocol (<eref target="http://www.robotstxt.org/">http://www.robotstxt.org/</eref>) specifies a way for automated processes to obtain permission
to access resources; likewise, the Platform for Privacy Preferences <xref target="P3P"/>
tells user-agents how to discover privacy policy before interacting with an origin server.</t>

<t>While there are several ways to access per-resource metadata (e.g., HTTP header fields, WebDAV’s
PROPFIND <xref target="RFC4918"/>), the perceived overhead (either in terms of client-perceived latency and/or
deployment difficulties) associated with them often precludes their use in these scenarios.</t>

<t>At the same time, it has become more popular to use HTTP as a substrate for non-Web protocols. Sometimes, such protocols need a way to locate one or more resources on a given host.</t>

<t>When this happens, one solution is to designate a “well-known location” for data or services related
to the origin overall, so that it can be easily located. However, this approach has the drawback of
risking collisions, both with other such designated “well-known locations” and with resources that
the origin has created (or wishes to create). Furthermore, defining well-known locations usurp’s
the origin’s control over its own URI space <xref target="RFC7320"/>.</t>

<t>To address these uses, this memo reserves a path prefix in HTTP, HTTPS, WS and WSS URIs for these
“well-known locations”, “/.well-known/”. Future specifications that need to define a resource for
such metadata can register their use to avoid collisions and minimise impingement upon origins’ URI
space.</t>

<t>Well-known URIs can also be used with other URI schemes, but only when those schemes’
definitions explicitly allow it.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="notational-conventions" title="Notational Conventions">

<t>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”,
“RECOMMENDED”, “NOT RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as
described in BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as
shown here.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="well-known" title="Well-Known URIs">

<t>A well-known URI is a URI <xref target="RFC3986"/> whose path component begins with the characters
“/.well-known/”, and whose scheme is “http” <xref target="RFC7230"/>, “https” <xref target="RFC7230"/>, “ws” <xref target="RFC6455"/>,
“wss” <xref target="RFC6455"/>, or another scheme that has explicitly been specified to use well-known URIs.</t>

<t>For example, if an application registers the name ‘example’, the corresponding well-known URI on
‘http://www.example.com/’ would be ‘http://www.example.com/.well-known/example’.</t>

<t>Applications that wish to mint new well-known URIs MUST register them, following the procedures in
<xref target="register"/>, subject to the following requirements.</t>

<t>Registered names MUST conform to the segment-nz production in <xref target="RFC3986"/>. This means they cannot
contain the “/” character.</t>

<t>Registered names for a specific application SHOULD be correspondingly precise; “squatting” on
generic terms is not encouraged. For example, if the Example application wants a well-known
location for metadata, an appropriate registered name might be “example-metadata” or even
“example.com-metadata”, not “metadata”.</t>

<t>At a minimum, a registration will reference a specification that defines the format and associated
media type(s) to be obtained by dereferencing the well-known URI, along with the URI scheme(s) that
the well-known URI can be used with. If no URI schemes are explicitly specified, “http” and “https”
are assumed.</t>

<t>Typically, applications will use the default port for the given scheme; if an alternative port is
used, it MUST be explicitly specified by the application in question.</t>

<t>Registrations MAY also contain additional information, such as the syntax of additional path
components, query strings and/or fragment identifiers to be appended to the well-known URI, or
protocol-specific details (e.g., HTTP <xref target="RFC7231"/> method handling).</t>

<t>Note that this specification defines neither how to determine the hostname to use to find the
well-known URI for a particular application, nor the scope of the metadata discovered by
dereferencing the well-known URI; both should be defined by the application itself.</t>

<t>Also, this specification does not define a format or media-type for the resource located at
“/.well-known/” and clients should not expect a resource to exist at that location.</t>

<t>Well-known URIs are rooted in the top of the path’s hierarchy; they are not well-known by
definition in other parts of the path. For example, “/.well-known/example” is a well-known URI,
whereas “/foo/.well-known/example” is not.</t>

<t>See also <xref target="sec"/> for Security Considerations regarding well-known locations.</t>

<section anchor="procedure" title="Registering Well-Known URIs">

<t>The “Well-Known URIs” registry is located at “https://www.iana.org/assignments/well-known-uris/”.
Registration requests can be made by following the instructions located there or by sending an
email to the “wellknown-uri-review@ietf.org” mailing list.</t>

<t>Registration requests consist of at least the following information:</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText='URI suffix:'>
  The name requested for the well-known URI, relative to “/.well-known/”; e.g., “example”.</t>
  <t hangText='Change controller:'>
  For Standards-Track RFCs, state “IETF”. For others, give the name of the responsible party. Other
details (e.g., e-mail address, home page URI) may also be included.</t>
  <t hangText='Specification document(s):'>
  Reference to the document that specifies the field, preferably including a URI that can be used
to retrieve a copy of the document. An indication of the relevant sections may also be included,
but is not required.</t>
  <t hangText='Status:'>
  One of “permanent” or “provisional”. See guidance below.</t>
  <t hangText='Related information:'>
  Optionally, citations to additional documents containing further relevant information.</t>
</list></t>

<t>General requirements for registered values are described in <xref target="well-known"/>.</t>

<t>Values defined by standards-track RFCs and other open standards (in the sense of <xref target="RFC2026"/>, Section 7.1.1) have a status of “permanent”. Other values can also be registered as permanent, if the Experts find that they are in use, in consultation with the community. Other values should be registered as “provisional”.</t>

<t>Provisional entries can be removed by the Experts if – in consultation with the community – the
Experts find that they are not in use. The Experts can change a provisional entry’s status to
permanent; in doing so, the Experts should consider how widely used a value is, and consult the
community beforehand.</t>

<t>Note that “consult with the community” above refers to those responsible for the URI scheme(s) in
question. Generally, this would take place on the mailing list(s) of the appropriate Working
Group(s) (possibly historical), or on art@ietf.org if no such list exists.</t>

<t>Well-known URIs can be registered by third parties (including the expert(s)), if the expert(s)
determine that an unregistered well-known URI is widely deployed and not likely to be registered
in a timely manner otherwise. Such registrations still are subject to the requirements defined,
including the need to reference a specification.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="sec" title="Security Considerations">

<t>Applications minting new well-known URIs, as well as administrators deploying them, will need to
consider several security-related issues, including (but not limited to) exposure of sensitive
data, denial-of-service attacks (in addition to normal load issues), server and client
authentication, vulnerability to DNS rebinding attacks, and attacks where limited access to a
server grants the ability to affect how well-known URIs are served.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC3552"/> contains some examples of potential security considerations that may be relevant to
application protocols and administrators deploying them.</t>

<section anchor="protecting-well-known-resources" title="Protecting Well-Known Resources">

<t>Because well-known locations effectively represent the entire origin, server operators should
appropriately control the ability to write to them. This is especially true when more than one
entity is co-located on the same origin. Even for origins that are controlled by and represent a
single entity, due care should be taken to assure that write access to well-known locations is not
granted unwittingly, either externally through server configuration, or locally through
implementation permissions (e.g., on a filesystem).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="interaction-with-web-browsing" title="Interaction with Web Browsing">

<t>Applications using well-known URIs for “http” or “https” URLs need to be aware that well-known
resources will be accessible to Web browsers, and therefore are able to be manipulated by content
obtained from other parts of that origin. If an attacker is able to inject content (e.g., through a
Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability), they will be able to make potentially arbitrary requests to
the well-known resource.</t>

<t>HTTP and HTTPS also use origins as a security boundary for many other mechanisms, including (but
not limited to) Cookies <xref target="RFC6265"/>, Web Storage <xref target="WEBSTORAGE"/> and
many capabilities.</t>

<t>Applications defining well-known locations should not assume that they have sole access to these
mechanisms, or that they are the only application using the origin. Depending on the nature of the application, mitigations can include:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Encrypting sensitive information</t>
  <t>Allowing flexibility in the use of identifiers (e.g., Cookie names) to avoid collisions with other applications</t>
  <t>Using the ‘HttpOnly’ flag on Cookies to assure that cookies are not exposed to browser scripting languages <xref target="RFC6265"/></t>
  <t>Using the ‘Path’ parameter on Cookies to assure that they are not available to other parts of the origin <xref target="RFC6265"/></t>
  <t>Using X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff <xref target="FETCH"/> to assure that content under attacker control can’t be coaxed into a form that is interpreted as active content by a Web browser</t>
</list></t>

<t>Other good practices include:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Using an application-specific media type in the Content-Type header field, and requiring clients to fail if it is not used</t>
  <t>Using Content-Security-Policy <xref target="CSP"/> to constrain the capabilities of active content (such as HTML <xref target="HTML5"/>), thereby mitigating Cross-Site Scripting attacks</t>
  <t>Using Referrer-Policy <xref target="REFERRER-POLICY"/> to prevent sensitive data in URLs from being leaked in the Referer request header field</t>
  <t>Avoiding use of compression on any sensitive information (e.g., authentication tokens, passwords), as the scripting environment offered by Web browsers allows an attacker to repeatedly probe the compression space; if the attacker has access to the path of the communication, they can use this capability to recover that information.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="scoping-applications" title="Scoping Applications">

<t>This memo does not specify the scope of applicability for the information obtained from a
well-known URI, and does not specify how to discover a well-known URI for a particular application.</t>

<t>Individual applications using this mechanism must define both aspects; if this is not specified,
security issues can arise from implementation deviations and confusion about boundaries between
applications.</t>

<t>Applying metadata discovered in a well-known URI to resources other than those co-located on the
same origin risks administrative as well as security issues. For example, allowing
“https://example.com/.well-known/example” to apply policy to “https://department.example.com”,
“https://www.example.com” or even “https://www.example.com:8000” assumes a relationship between
hosts where there might be none, giving control to a potential attacker.</t>

<t>Likewise, specifying that a well-known URI on a particular hostname is to be used to bootstrap a
protocol can cause a large number of undesired requests. For example, if a well-known HTTPS URI is
used to find policy about a separate service such as e-mail, it can result in a flood of requests
to Web servers, even if they don’t implement the well-known URI. Such undesired requests can
resemble a denial-of-services attack.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="hidden-capabilities" title="Hidden Capabilities">

<t>Applications using well-known locations should consider that some server administrators might be
unaware of its existence (especially on operating systems that hide directories whose names begin
with “.”). This means that if an attacker has write access to the .well-known directory, they would
be able to control its contents, possibly without the administrator realising it.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="iana-considerations" title="IANA Considerations">

<section anchor="register" title="The Well-Known URI Registry">

<t>This specification updates the registration procedures for the “Well-Known URI” registry, first
defined in <xref target="RFC5785"/>; see <xref target="procedure"/>.</t>

<t>Well-known URIs are registered on the advice of one or more Experts, with a Specification Required (using terminology from <xref target="RFC8126"/>).</t>

<t>The Experts’ primary considerations in evaluating registration requests are:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Conformance to the requirements in <xref target="well-known"/></t>
  <t>The availability and stability of the specifying document</t>
  <t>The considerations outlined in <xref target="sec"/></t>
</list></t>

<t>IANA will direct any incoming requests regarding the registry to this document and, if defined, the
processes established by the expert(s); typically, this will mean referring them to the registry
Web page.</t>

<t>Upon publication, IANA should:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Update the status of all existing registrations to “permanent”.</t>

<title>HTTP State Management Mechanism</title>
<author initials='A.' surname='Barth' fullname='A. Barth'><organization /></author>
<date year='2011' month='April' />
<abstract><t>This document defines the HTTP Cookie and Set-Cookie header fields. These header fields can be used by HTTP servers to store state (called cookies) at HTTP user agents, letting the servers maintain a stateful session over the mostly stateless HTTP protocol.  Although cookies have many historical infelicities that degrade their security and privacy, the Cookie and Set-Cookie header fields are widely used on the Internet.  This document obsoletes RFC 2965.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract>

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText='Aren’t well-known locations bad for the Web?'>
  They are, but for various reasons – both technical and social – they are sometimes necessary.
This memo defines a “sandbox” for them, to reduce the risks of collision and to minimise the impact
upon pre-existing URIs on sites.</t>
  <t hangText='Why /.well-known?'>
  It’s short, descriptive, and according to search indices, not widely used.</t>
  <t hangText='What impact does this have on existing mechanisms, such as P3P and robots.txt?'>
  None, until they choose to use this mechanism.</t>
  <t hangText='Why aren’t per-directory well-known locations defined?'>
  Allowing every URI path segment to have a well-known location (e.g., “/images/.well-known/”) would
increase the risks of colliding with a pre-existing URI on a site, and generally these solutions
are found not to scale well, because they’re too “chatty”.</t>
