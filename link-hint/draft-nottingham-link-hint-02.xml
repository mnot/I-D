<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>HTTP <xref target="RFC7230"/> clients can discover a variety of information about a resource by interacting with
it. For example, the methods supported can be learned through the Allow response header field,
and the need for authentication is conveyed with a 401 Authentication Required status code.</t>

<t>Often, it can be beneficial to know this information before interacting with the resource; not only
can it save time (through reduced round trips), but it can also affect the choices given to the
code or user driving the interaction.</t>

<t>For example, a user interface that presents the data from an HTTP-based API might need to know
which resources the user has write access to, so that it can present the appropriate interface.</t>

<t>This specification defines a vocabulary of “HTTP link hints” that allow such metadata about HTTP
resources to be attached to Web links <xref target="RFC8288"/>, thereby making it available before the link is
followed. It also establishes a registry for future hints.</t>

<t>Hints are just that – they are not a “contract”, and are to only be taken as advisory. The runtime
behaviour of the resource always overrides hinted information.</t>

<t>For example, a client might receive a hint that the PUT method is allowed on all “widget”
resources. This means that generally, the client can PUT to them, but a specific resource might
reject a PUT based upon access control or other considerations.</t>

<t>More fine-grained information might also be gathered by interacting with the resource (e.g., via a
GET), or by another resource “containing” it (such as a “widgets” collection) or describing it
(e.g., one linked to it with a “describedby” link relation).</t>

<t>There is not a single way to carry hints in a link; rather, it is expected that this will be done
by individual link serialisations (see <xref target="RFC8288"/>, Section 3.4.1). However, <xref target="link_header"/> does
recommend how to include link hints in the existing Link HTTP header field.</t>

<section anchor="notational-conventions" title="Notational Conventions">

<t>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”,
“RECOMMENDED”, “NOT RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as
described in BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as
shown here.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="link_hints" title="HTTP Link Hints">

<t>A HTTP link hint is a (key, value) tuple that describes the target resource of a Web link
<xref target="RFC8288"/>, or the link itself. The value’s canonical form is a JSON <xref target="RFC8259"/> data structure specific to that hint.</t>

<t>Typically, link hints are serialised in links as target attributes (<xref target="RFC8288"/>, Section 3.4.1).</t>

<t>In JSON-based formats, this can be achieved by simply serialising link hints as an object; for
example:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
{
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "/orders/523",
       "hints": {
        "allow": ["GET", "POST"],
        "accept-post": {
          "application/example+json":
            {}
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>In other link formats, this requires a mapping from the canonical JSON data model. One such mapping
is described in <xref target="link_header"/> for the Link HTTP header field.</t>

<t>The information in a link hint SHOULD NOT be considered valid for longer than the freshness
lifetime (<xref target="RFC7234"/>, Section 4.2) of the representation that the link occurred within, and
in some cases, it might be valid for a considerably shorter period.</t>

<t>Likewise, the information in a link hint is specific to the link it is attached to. This means that
if a representation is specific to a particular user, the hints on links in that representation are
also specific to that user.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="hints" title="Pre-Defined HTTP Link Hints">

<section anchor="allow" title="allow">

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Hint Name: allow</t>
  <t>Description: Hints the HTTP methods that can be used to interact with the target resource;
equivalent to the Allow HTTP response header.</t>
  <t>Content Model: array (of strings)</t>
  <t>Specification: [this document]</t>
</list></t>

<t>Content MUST be an array of strings, containing HTTP methods (<xref target="RFC7231"/>, Section 4).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="formats" title="formats">

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Hint Name: formats</t>
  <t>Description: Hints the representation type(s) that the target resource can produce and consume,
using the GET and PUT (if allowed) methods respectively.</t>
  <t>Content Model: object</t>
  <t>Specification: [this document]</t>
</list></t>

<t>Content MUST be an object, whose keys are media types (<xref target="RFC7231"/>, Section 3.1.1.1), and values
are objects.</t>

<t>The object MAY have a “links” member, whose value is an object representing links (in the sense of
<xref target="RFC8288"/>) whose context is any document that uses that format. Generally, this will be schema or
profile (<xref target="RFC6906"/>) information. The “links” member has the same format as the “links” hint.</t>

<t>Furthermore, the object MAY have a “deprecated” member, whose value is either true or false,
indicating whether support for the format might be removed in the near future.</t>

<t>All other members of the object are under control of the corresponding media type’s definition.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="links" title="links">

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Hint Name: links</t>
  <t>Description: Hints at links whose context is the target resource.</t>
  <t>Content Model: object</t>
  <t>Specification: [this document]</t>
</list></t>

<t>The “links” hint contains links (in the sense of <xref target="RFC8288"/>) whose context is the hinted target
resource, which are stable for the lifetime of the hint.</t>

<t>Content MUST be an object, whose member names are link relations (<xref target="RFC8288"/>) and values are
objects that MUST have an “href” member whose value is a URI-reference (<xref target="RFC3986"/>, using the
original link as the base for resolution) for the link hint’s target resource, and MAY itself
contain link hints, serialised as the value for a “hints” member.</t>

<t>For example:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
"links": {
  "edit-form": {
    "href": "./edit",
    "hints": {
      formats: {
        "application/json": {}
      }
    }
  }
}
]]></artwork></figure>

</section>
<section anchor="accept-post" title="accept-post">

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Hint Name: accept-post</t>
  <t>Description: Hints the POST request format(s) that the target resource can consume.</t>
  <t>Content Model: object</t>
  <t>Specification: [this document]</t>
</list></t>

<t>Content MUST be an object, with the same constraints as for “formats”.</t>

<t>When this hint is present, “POST” SHOULD be listed in the “allow” hint.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="accept-patch" title="accept-patch">

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Hint Name: accept-patch</t>
  <t>Description: Hints the PATCH <xref target="RFC5789"/> request format(s) that the target resource can consume;
equivalent to the Accept-Patch HTTP response header.</t>
  <t>Content Model: array (of strings)</t>
  <t>Specification: [this document]</t>
</list></t>

<t>Content MUST be an array of strings, containing media types (<xref target="RFC7231"/>, Section 3.1.1.1).</t>

<t>When this hint is present, “PATCH” SHOULD be listed in the “allow” hint.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="accept-ranges" title="accept-ranges">

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Hint Name: accept-ranges</t>
  <t>Description: Hints the range-specifier(s) available for the target resource; equivalent to the
Accept-Ranges HTTP response header <xref target="RFC7233"/>.</t>
  <t>Content Model: array (of strings)</t>
  <t>Specification: [this document]</t>
</list></t>

<t>Content MUST be an array of strings, containing HTTP range-specifiers (<xref target="RFC7233"/>, Section 3.1).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="accept-prefer" title="accept-prefer">

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Hint Name: accept-prefer</t>
  <t>Description: Hints the preference(s) <xref target="RFC7240"/> that the target resource understands (and might
act upon) in requests.</t>
  <t>Content Model: array (of strings)</t>
  <t>Specification: [this document]</t>
</list></t>

<t>Content MUST be an array of strings, contain preferences (<xref target="RFC7240"/>, Section 2). Note that, by
its nature, a preference can be ignored by the server.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="precondition-req" title="precondition-req">

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Hint Name: precondition-req</t>
  <t>Description: Hints that the target resource requires state-changing requests (e.g., PUT, PATCH)
to include a precondition, as per <xref target="RFC7232"/>, to avoid conflicts due to concurrent updates.</t>
  <t>Content Model: array (of strings)</t>
  <t>Specification: [this document]</t>
</list></t>

<t>Content MUST be an array of strings, with possible values “etag” and “last-modified” indicating
type of precondition expected.</t>

<t>See also the 428 Precondition Required status code (<xref target="RFC6585"/>).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="auth-schemes" title="auth-schemes">

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Hint Name: auth-schemes</t>
  <t>Description: Hints that the target resource requires authentication using the HTTP Authentication
Framework <xref target="RFC7235"/>.</t>
  <t>Content Model: array (of objects)</t>
  <t>Specification: [this document]</t>
</list></t>

<t>Content MUST be an array of objects, each with a “scheme” member containing a string that
corresponds to a HTTP authentication scheme (<xref target="RFC7235"/>), and optionally a “realms” member
containing an array of zero to many strings that identify protection spaces that the resource is a
member of.</t>

<t>For example:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
  {
    "auth-req": [
      {
        "scheme": "Basic",
        "realms": ["private"]
      }
    ]
  }
]]></artwork></figure>

</section>
<section anchor="status" title="status">

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Hint Name: status</t>
  <t>Description: Hints the status of the target resource.</t>
  <t>Content Model: string</t>
  <t>Specification: [this document]</t>
</list></t>

<t>Content MUST be a string; possible values are:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>“deprecated” - indicates that use of the resource is not recommended, but it is still available.</t>
  <t>“gone” - indicates that the resource is no longer available; i.e., it will return a 410 Gone HTTP
status code if accessed.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations">

<t>Clients need to exercise care when using hints. For example, a naive client might send credentials
to a server that uses the auth-req hint, without checking to see if those credentials are
appropriate for that server.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="iana-considerations" title="IANA Considerations">

<section anchor="hint_registry" title="HTTP Link Hint Registry">

<t>This specification defines the HTTP Link Hint Registry. See <xref target="link_hints"/> for a general
description of the function of link hints.</t>

<t>Link hints are generic; that is, they are potentially applicable to any HTTP resource, not specific
to one application of HTTP, nor to one particular format. Generally, they ought to be information
that would otherwise be discoverable by interacting with the resource.</t>

<t>Hint names MUST be composed of the lowercase letters (a-z), digits (0-9), underscores (“_”) and
hyphens (“-“), and MUST begin with a lowercase letter.</t>

<t>Hint content MUST be described in terms of JSON values (<xref target="RFC8259"/>, Section 3).</t>

<t>Hint semantics SHOULD be described in terms of the framework defined in <xref target="RFC8288"/>.</t>

<t>New hints are registered using the Expert Review process described in <xref target="RFC8126"/> to enforce the
criteria above. Requests for registration of new resource hints are to use the following template:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Hint Name: [hint name]</t>
  <t>Description: [a short description of the hint’s semantics]</t>
  <t>Content Model: [valid JSON value types; see RFC627 Section 2.1]</t>
  <t>Specification: [reference to specification document]</t>
</list></t>

<t>Initial registrations are enumerated in <xref target="hints"/>. The “rel”, “rev”, “hreflang”, “media”, “title”,
and “type” hint names are reserved, so as to avoid potential clashes with link serialisations.</t>

<title>The 'profile' Link Relation Type</title>
<author initials='E.' surname='Wilde' fullname='E. Wilde'><organization /></author>
<date year='2013' month='March' />
<abstract><t>This specification defines the 'profile' link relation type that allows resource representations to indicate that they are following one or more profiles.  A profile is defined not to alter the semantics of the resource representation itself, but to allow clients to learn about additional semantics (constraints, conventions, extensions) that are associated with the resource representation, in addition to those defined by the media type and possibly other mechanisms.</t></abstract>

<abstract><t>Many protocols make use of points of extensibility that use constants to identify various protocol parameters.  To ensure that the values in these fields do not have conflicting uses and to promote interoperability, their allocations are often coordinated by a central record keeper.  For IETF protocols, that role is filled by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).</t><t>To make assignments in a given registry prudently, guidance describing the conditions under which new values should be assigned, as well as when and how modifications to existing values can be made, is needed.  This document defines a framework for the documentation of these guidelines by specification authors, in order to assure that the provided guidance for the IANA Considerations is clear and addresses the various issues that are likely in the operation of a registry.</t><t>This is the third edition of this document; it obsoletes RFC 5226.</t></abstract>

<section anchor="link_header" title="Representing Link Hints in Link Headers">

<t>A link hint can be represented in a Link header (<xref target="RFC8288"/>, Section 3) as a link-extension.</t>

<t>When doing so, the JSON of the hint’s content SHOULD be normalised to reduce extraneous spaces
(%x20), and MUST NOT contain horizontal tabs (%x09), line feeds (%x0A) or carriage returns (%x0D).
When they are part of a string value, these characters MUST be escaped as described in <xref target="RFC8259"/>
Section 7; otherwise, they MUST be discarded.</t>

<t>Furthermore, if the content is an array or an object, the surrounding delimiters MUST be removed
before serialisation. In other words, the outermost object or array is represented without the
braces (“{}”) or brackets (“[]”) respectively, but this does not apply to inner objects or arrays.</t>

<t>For example, the two JSON values below are those of the fictitious “example” and “example1” hints,
respectively:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
"The Example Value"
1.2
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>In a Link header, they would be serialised as:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
Link: </>; rel="sample"; example="The Example Value";
      example1=1.2
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>A more complex, single value for “example”:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
[
  "foo",
  -1.23,
  true,
  ["charlie", "bennet"],
  {"cat": "thor"},
  false
]
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>would be serialised as:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
Link: </>; rel="sample"; example="\"foo\", -1.23, true,
      [\"charlie\", \"bennet\"], {"cat": \"thor\"}, false"
]]></artwork></figure>
