Internet-Draft               HTTP Link Hints                   June 2013


1.  Introduction

   Clients can discover a variety of information about HTTP
   [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging] resources by interacting with them.
   For example, the methods supported can be learned through the Allow
   response header field, whereas the need for authentication is
   conveyed with the 401 Authentication Required status code.

   In some situations, it can be beneficial to know this information
   before interacting with a resource; not only can it save time
   (through reduced round trips), but it can also affect the choices
   given to the code or user driving the interaction.

   For example, a user interface that presents the data from an HTTP-
   based API could use link hints to determine which resources the user
   has write access to, and modify the interface appropriately.

   HTTP link hints build upon Web links [RFC5988] to describe a
   vocabulary of such metadata about HTTP-based links.

   Hints are just that - they are not a "contract", and are to only be
   taken as advisory.  The runtime behaviour of the resource always
   overrides hinted information.

   For example, a client might receive a hint that the PUT method is
   allowed on all "widget" resources.  This means that generally, the
   client can PUT to them, but a specific resource might reject a PUT
   based upon access control or other considerations.  More fine-grained
   information might be gathered by interacting with the resource (e.g.,
   via a GET), or by another resource "containing" it (such as a
   "widgets" collection) or describing it (e.g., one linked to it with a
   "describedby" link relation).

   This specification defines a set of common hints for HTTP (and HTTPS)
   links, based upon information that's discoverable by directly
   interacting with resources.  It also establishes a registry for
   future hints.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  HTTP Link Hints

   A HTTP link hint is a (key, value) tuple that describes the target



Nottingham              Expires December 6, 2013                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft               HTTP Link Hints                   June 2013


   resource of a Web link [RFC5988], or the link itself.  The value's
   canonical form is a JSON [RFC4627] data structure.  Typically, they
   are serialised in links as target attributes.

   In JSON formats, this can be achieved by simply serialising link
   hints as an object; for example:

   {
     "_links": {
       "self": {
         "href": "/orders/523",
          "hints": {
           "allow": ["GET", "POST"],
           "accept-post": {
             "application/example+json":
               {}
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }

   (Note that this specification does not advocate any particular format
   for links in JSON.)

   In other link formats, this requires a mapping from the canonical
   JSON data model.  One such mapping for the Link HTTP header is
   described in Appendix A.

   The information in a link hint SHOULD NOT be considered valid for
   longer than the freshness lifetime ([I-D.ietf-httpbis-p6-cache]) of
   the representation that the link occurred within, and in some cases,
   it might be valid for a considerably shorter period.


3.  Pre-Defined HTTP Link Hints

3.1.  allow

   o  Hint Name: allow
   o  Description: Hints the HTTP methods that the current client can
      use to interact with the target resource; equivalent to the Allow
      HTTP response header.
   o  Content Model: array (of strings)
   o  Specification: [this document]

   Content MUST be an array of strings, containing HTTP methods.

Internet-Draft               HTTP Link Hints                   June 2013


3.2.  formats

   o  Hint Name: formats
   o  Description: Hints the representation type(s) that the target
      resource can produce and consume, using the GET and PUT (if
      allowed) methods respectively.
   o  Content Model: object
   o  Specification: [this document]

   Content MUST be an object, whose keys are media types, and values are
   objects.

   The object MAY have a "links" member, whose value is an object
   representing links whose context is any document that uses that
   format.  Generally, this will be schema or profile ([RFC6906])
   information.  The "links" member has the same format as the "links"
   hint.

   Furthermore, the object MAY have a "deprecated" member, whose value
   is either true or false, indicating whether support for the format
   might be removed in the near future.

   All other members of the object are under control of the
   corresponding media type's definition.

3.3.  links

   o  Hint Name: links
   o  Description: Hints at links whose context is the target resource.
   o  Content Model: object
   o  Specification: [this document]

   The "links" hint contains links that are specific to the resource,
   and stable for the lifetime of the hint.

   Content MUST be an object, whose member names are link relations
   ([RFC5988]) and values are objects that MUST have an "href" member
   whose value is a URI-reference ([RFC3986], using the original link as
   the base for resolution) for the link hint's target resource, and MAY
   itself contain link hints, serialised as the value for a "hints"
   member.

   For example:

   "links": {
     "edit-form": {
       "href": "./edit",
       "hints": {
         formats: {
           "application/json": {}
         }
       }
     }
   }

3.4.  accept-post

   o  Hint Name: accept-post
   o  Description: Hints the POST request format(s) that the target
      resource can consume.
   o  Content Model: object
   o  Specification: [this document]

   Content MUST be an object, with the same constraints as for
   "formats".

   When this hint is present, "POST" SHOULD be listed in the "allow"
   hint.

3.5.  accept-patch

   o  Hint Name: accept-patch
   o  Description: Hints the PATCH [RFC5789] request format(s) that the
      target resource can consume; equivalent to the Accept-Patch HTTP
      response header.
   o  Content Model: array (of strings)
   o  Specification: [this document]

   Content MUST be an array of strings, containing media types.  Note
   that there is no opportunity to communicate format-specific hints for
   PATCH formats.

   When this hint is present, "PATCH" SHOULD be listed in the "allow"
   hint.

3.6.  accept-ranges

   o  Hint Name: accept-ranges
   o  Description: Hints the range-specifier(s) available to the client
      for the target resource; equivalent to the Accept-Ranges HTTP
      response header [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p5-range].

Internet-Draft               HTTP Link Hints                   June 2013


   o  Content Model: array (of strings)
   o  Specification: [this document]

   Content MUST be an array of strings, containing HTTP range-
   specifiers.

3.7.  accept-prefer

   o  Hint Name: accept-prefer
   o  Description: Hints the preference(s) [I-D.snell-http-prefer] that
      the target resource understands (and might act upon) in requests.
   o  Content Model: array (of strings)
   o  Specification: [this document]

   Content MUST be an array of strings, contain preferences.  Note that,
   by its nature, a preference can be ignored by the server.

3.8.  precondition-req

   o  Hint Name: precondition-req
   o  Description: Hints that the target resource requires state-
      changing requests (e.g., PUT, PATCH) to include a precondition, as
      per [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p4-conditional], to avoid conflicts due to
      concurrent updates.
   o  Content Model: array (of strings)
   o  Specification: [this document]

   Content MUST be an array of strings, with possible values "etag" and
   "last-modified" indicating type of precondition expected.

   See also the 428 Precondition Required status code ([RFC6585]).

3.9.  auth-schemes

   o  Hint Name: auth-schemes
   o  Description: Hints that the target resource requires
      authentication using the HTTP Authentication Framework
      [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p7-auth].
   o  Content Model: array (of objects)
   o  Specification: [this document]

   Content MUST be an array of objects, each with a "scheme" member
   containing a string that corresponds to a HTTP authentication scheme,
   and optionally a "realms" member containing an array of zero to many
   strings that identify protection spaces that the resource is a member
   of.

   For example:

Internet-Draft               HTTP Link Hints                   June 2013


     {
       "auth-req": [
         {
           "scheme": "Basic",
           "realms": ["private"]
         }
       ]
     }

3.10.  status

   o  Hint Name: status
   o  Description: Hints the status of the target resource.
   o  Content Model: string
   o  Specification: [this document]

   Content MUST be a string; possible values are:

   o  "deprecated" - indicates that use of the resource is not
      recommended, but it is still available.
   o  "gone" - indicates that the resource is no longer available; i.e.,
      it will return a 410 Gone HTTP status code if accessed.


4.  Security Considerations

   Clients need to exercise care when using hints.  For example, a naive
   client might send credentials to a server that uses the auth-req
   hint, without checking to see if those credentials are appropriate
   for that server.


5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  HTTP Link Hint Registry

   This specification defines the HTTP Link Hint Registry.  See
   Section 2 for a general description of the function of link hints.

   Link hints are generic; that is, they are potentially applicable to
   any resource, not specific to one application of HTTP, nor to one
   particular format.  Generally, they ought to be information that
   would otherwise be discoverable by interacting with the resource.

   Hint names MUST be composed of the lowercase letters (a-z), digits
   (0-9), underscores ("_") and hyphens ("-"), and MUST begin with a
   lowercase letter.

Internet-Draft               HTTP Link Hints                   June 2013


   Hint content MUST be described in terms of JSON values ([RFC4627],
   Section 2.1).

   Hint semantics SHOULD be described in terms of the framework defined
   in [RFC5988].

   New hints are registered using the Expert Review process described in
   [RFC5226] to enforce the criteria above.  Requests for registration
   of new resource hints are to use the following template:

   o  Hint Name: [hint name]
   o  Description: [a short description of the hint's semantics]
   o  Content Model: [valid JSON value types; see RFC627 Section 2.1]
   o  Specification: [reference to specification document]

   Initial registrations are enumerated in Section 3.  The "rel", "rev",
   "hreflang", "media", "title", and "type" hint names are reserved, so
   as to avoid potential clashes with link serialisations.

Appendix A.  Representing Link Hints in Link Headers

   A link hint can be represented in a Link header ([RFC5988], Section
   5) as a link-extension.

   When doing so, the JSON of the hint's content SHOULD be normalised to



Nottingham              Expires December 6, 2013               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft               HTTP Link Hints                   June 2013


   reduce extraneous spaces (%x20), and MUST NOT contain horizontal tabs
   (%x09), line feeds (%x0A) or carriage returns (%x0D).  When they are
   part of a string value, these characters MUST be escaped as described
   in [RFC4627] Section 2.5; otherwise, they MUST be discarded.

   Furthermore, if the content is an array or an object, the surrounding
   delimiters MUST be removed before serialisation.  In other words, the
   outermost object or array is represented without the braces ("{}") or
   brackets ("[]") respectively, but this does not apply to inner
   objects or arrays.

   For example, the two JSON values below are those of the fictitious
   "example" and "exmaple1" hints, respectively:

   "The Example Value"
   1.2

   In a Link header, they would be serialised as:

   Link: </>; rel="sample"; example="The Example Value";
         example1=1.2

   A more complex, single value for "example":

   [
     "foo",
     -1.23,
     true,
     ["charlie", "bennet"],
     {"cat": "thor"},
     false
   ]

   would be serialised as:

   ~~~ Link: </>; rel="sample"; example=""foo", -1.23, true, ["charlie",
   "bennet"], {"cat": "thor"}, false" ~~
