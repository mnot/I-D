      <t>This memo specifies “HTTP Link Hints”, a mechanism for annotating Web links to
HTTP(S) resources with information that otherwise might be discovered by
interacting with them.</t>

    <note title="Note to Readers">
      <t>This draft should be discussed on the apps-discuss mailing list; see
<xref target="apps-discuss"/>.</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>Clients can discover a variety of information about a HTTP
<xref target="I-D.ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging"/> resource by interacting with it. For
example, the methods supported can be learned through the Allow response header
field, whereas the need for authentication is conveyed with a 401
Authentication Required status code.</t>
      <t>In some situations, it can be beneficial to know this information before
interacting with the resource; not only can it save time (through reduced round
trips), but it can also affect the choices given to the code or user driving
the interaction.</t>
      <t>For example, a user interface that presents the data from an HTTP-based API
might need to know which resources the user has write access to, so that it can
present the appropriate interface.</t>
      <t>This specification defines a vocabulary of “HTTP link hints” that allow such
metadata about HTTP resources to be attached to Web links <xref target="RFC5988"/>, thereby
making it available before the link is followed. It also establishes a registry
for future hints.</t>
      <t>It does not recommend a single serialisation format for link hints; rather, it
is expected that this will be done by individual link serialisations that use
hints (whether they be in a representation body, message headers or elsewhere). However, <xref target="link_header"/> does recommend how to include link hints in the
existing Link HTTP header field.</t>
      <t>Hints are just that – they are not a “contract”, and are to only be taken as
advisory. The runtime behaviour of the resource always overrides hinted
information.</t>
      <t>For example, a client might receive a hint that the PUT method is allowed on
all “widget” resources. This means that generally, the client can PUT to them,
but a specific resource might reject a PUT based upon access control or other
considerations. </t>
      <t>More fine-grained information might be gathered by interacting with the
resource (e.g., via a GET), or by another resource “containing” it (such as a
“widgets” collection) or describing it (e.g., one linked to it with a
“describedby” link relation).</t>
      <section anchor="notational-conventions" title="Notational Conventions">
        <t>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”,
“SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be
interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
      </section>

    <section anchor="link_hints" title="HTTP Link Hints">
      <t>A HTTP link hint is a (key, value) tuple that describes the target resource of
a Web link <xref target="RFC5988"/>, or the link itself. The value’s canonical form is a
JSON <xref target="RFC4627"/> data structure, whose form is defined by the hint’s
definition. </t>
      <t>Typically, they are serialised in links as target attributes.</t>
      <t>In JSON-based formats, this can be achieved by simply serialising link hints as
an object; for example:</t>
      <figure>
        <artwork><![CDATA[
{
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "/orders/523",
       "hints": {
        "allow": ["GET", "POST"],
        "accept-post": {
          "application/example+json":
            {}
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
]]></artwork>
      </figure>
      <t>In other link formats, this requires a mapping from the canonical JSON data
model. One such mapping for the Link HTTP header is described in
<xref target="link_header"/>.</t>
      <t>The information in a link hint SHOULD NOT be considered valid for longer than
the freshness lifetime (<xref target="I-D.ietf-httpbis-p6-cache"/>) of the representation
that the link occurred within, and in some cases, it might be valid for a
considerably shorter period.</t>
      <t>Likewise, the information in a link hint is specific to the link it is attached
to. This means that if a representation is specific to a particular user, the
hints on links in that representation are also specific to that user.</t>

        <t>This specification defines the HTTP Link Hint Registry. See <xref target="link_hints"/>
for a general description of the function of link hints.</t>
        <t>Link hints are generic; that is, they are potentially applicable to any HTTP
resource, not specific to one application of HTTP, nor to one particular
format. Generally, they ought to be information that would otherwise be
discoverable by interacting with the resource.</t>
        <t>Hint names MUST be composed of the lowercase letters (a-z), digits (0-9),
underscores (“_”) and hyphens (“-“), and MUST begin with a lowercase letter.</t>
        <t>Hint content MUST be described in terms of JSON values (<xref target="RFC4627"/>, Section
2.1).</t>
        <t>Hint semantics SHOULD be described in terms of the framework defined in
<xref target="RFC5988"/>.</t>
        <t>New hints are registered using the Expert Review process described in
<xref target="RFC5226"/> to enforce the criteria above. Requests for registration of new
resource hints are to use the following template:</t>
        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>Hint Name: [hint name]</t>
            <t>Description: [a short description of the hint’s semantics]</t>

            <t>Specification: [reference to specification document]</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>Initial registrations are enumerated in <xref target="hints"/>. The “rel”, “rev”,
“hreflang”, “media”, “title”, and “type” hint names are reserved, so as to
avoid potential clashes with link serialisations.</t>

   In many standards track documents several words are used to signify
   the requirements in the specification.  These words are often
   capitalized.  This document defines these words as they should be
   interpreted in IETF documents.  Authors who follow these guidelines
   should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of their document:

A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact sequence of characters
that identifies an abstract or physical resource.  This specification
defines the generic URI syntax and a process for resolving URI references
that might be in relative form, along with guidelines and security
considerations for the use of URIs on the Internet.
The URI syntax defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid URIs,
allowing an implementation to parse the common components of a URI
reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every
possible identifier.  This specification does not define a generative
grammar for URIs; that task is performed by the individual
specifications of each URI scheme.

          <abstract>
            <t>Many protocols make use of identifiers consisting of constants and other well-known values. Even after a protocol has been defined and deployment has begun, new values may need to be assigned (e.g., for a new option type in DHCP, or a new encryption or authentication transform for IPsec). To ensure that such quantities have consistent values and interpretations across all implementations, their assignment must be administered by a central authority. For IETF protocols, that role is provided by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).&lt;/t&gt;&lt;t&gt; In order for IANA to manage a given namespace prudently, it needs guidelines describing the conditions under which new values can be assigned or when modifications to existing values can be made. If IANA is expected to play a role in the management of a namespace, IANA must be given clear and concise instructions describing that role. This document discusses issues that should be considered in formulating a policy for assigning values to a namespace and provides guidelines for authors on the specific text that must be included in documents that place demands on IANA.&lt;/t&gt;&lt;t&gt; This document obsoletes RFC 2434. This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</t>

      <t>A link hint can be represented in a Link header (<xref target="RFC5988"/>, Section 5) as a
link-extension.</t>
      <t>When doing so, the JSON of the hint’s content SHOULD be normalised to reduce
extraneous spaces (%x20), and MUST NOT contain horizontal tabs (%x09), line
feeds (%x0A) or carriage returns (%x0D). When they are part of a string value,
these characters MUST be escaped as described in <xref target="RFC4627"/> Section 2.5;
otherwise, they MUST be discarded.</t>
      <t>Furthermore, if the content is an array or an object, the surrounding
delimiters MUST be removed before serialisation. In other words, the outermost
object or array is represented without the braces (“{}”) or brackets (“[]”)
respectively, but this does not apply to inner objects or arrays.</t>
      <t>For example, the two JSON values below are those of the fictitious “example” and “exmaple1” hints, respectively:</t>
