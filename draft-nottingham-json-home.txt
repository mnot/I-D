1.  Introduction

   It is becoming increasingly common to use HTTP [RFC7230] for
   applications other than traditional Web browsing.  Such "HTTP APIs"
   are used to integrate processes on disparate systems, make
   information available to machines across the Internet, and as part of
   the implementation of "microservices."

   By using HTTP, these applications realise a number of benefits, from
   message framing to caching, and well-defined semantics that are
   broadly understood and useful.

   Often, these applications of HTTP are defined by documenting static
   URLs that clients need to know and servers need to implement.  Any
   interaction outside of these bounds is uncharted territory.

   For some applications, this approach brings issues, especially when
   the interface changes, either due to evolution, extension or drift
   between implementations.  Furthermore, implementing more than one
   instance of interface can bring further issues, as different
   environments have different requirements.

   The Web itself offers one way to address these issues, using links
   [RFC3986] to navigate between states.  A link-driven application
   discovers relevant resources at run time, using a shared vocabulary
   of link relations [RFC8288] and internet media types [RFC6838] to
   support a "follow your nose" style of interaction -- just as a Web
   browser does to navigate the Web.

   A client can then decide which resources to interact with "on the
   fly" based upon its capabilities (as described by link relations),
   and the server can safely add new resources and formats without
   disturbing clients that are not yet aware of them.

   Doing so can provide any of a number of benefits, including:

   *  Extensibility - Because new server capabilities can be expressed
      as resources typed by link relations, new features can be layered
      in without introducing a new API version; clients will discover
      them in the home document.  This promotes loose coupling between
      clients and servers.

   *  Evolvability - Likewise, interfaces can change gradually by
      introducing a new link relation and/or format while still
      supporting the old ones.

   *  Customisation - Home documents can be tailored for the client,
      allowing different classes of service or different client roles
      and permissions to be exposed naturally.

   *  Flexible deployment - Since URLs aren't baked into documentation,
      the server can choose what URLs to use for a given service.

   *  API mixing - Likewise, more than one API can be deployed on a
      given server, without fear of collisions.

   Whether an application ought to use links in this fashion depends on
   how it is deployed; generally, the most benefit will be received when
   multiple instances of the service are deployed, possibly with
   different versions, and they are consumed by clients with different
   capabilities.  In particular, Internet Standards that use HTTP as a
   substrate are likely to require the attributes described above.

   This document defines a "home document" format using the JSON format
   [RFC7159] for APIs to use as a launching point for the interactions
   they offer, using links.  Having a well-defined format for this
   purpose promotes good practice and development of tooling.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  API Home Documents

   An API Home Document (or "home document") uses the format described
   in [RFC7159] and has the media type "application/json-home".

   *Note: this media type is not final, and will change before final
   publication.*

   Its content consists of a root object with:

   *  A "resources" member, whose value is an object that describes the
      resources of the API.  Its member names are link relation types
      (as defined by [RFC8288]), and their values are Resource Objects
      (Section 4).

   *  Optionally, a "api" member, whose value is an API Object
      (Section 3) that contains information about the API as a whole.

   For example:

   GET / HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.org
   Accept: application/json-home

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json-home
   Cache-Control: max-age=3600
   Connection: close

   {
     "api": {
       "title": "Example API",
       "links": {
         "author": "mailto:api-admin@example.com",
         "describedBy": "https://example.com/api-docs/"
       }
     },
     "resources": {
       "tag:me@example.com,2016:widgets": {
         "href": "/widgets/"
       },
       "tag:me@example.com,2016:widget": {
         "hrefTemplate": "/widgets/{widget_id}",
         "hrefVars": {
           "widget_id": "https://example.org/param/widget"
         },
         "hints": {
           "allow": ["GET", "PUT", "DELETE", "PATCH"],
           "formats": {
             "application/json": {}
           },
           "acceptPatch": ["application/json-patch+json"],
           "acceptRanges": ["bytes"]
         }
       }
     }
   }

   Here, we have a home document for the API "Example API", whose author
   can be contacted at the e-mail address "api-admin@example.com", and
   whose documentation is at "https://example.com/api-docs/".

   It links to a resource "/widgets/" with the relation
   "tag:me@example.com,2016:widgets".  It also links to an unknown
   number of resources with the relation type
   "tag:me@example.com,2016:widget" using a URI Template [RFC6570],
   along with a mapping of identifiers to a variable for use in that
   template.

   It also gives several hints about interacting with the latter
   "widget" resources, including the HTTP methods usable with them, the
   PATCH and POST formats they accept, and the fact that they support
   partial requests [RFC7233] using the "bytes" range-specifier.

   It gives no such hints about the "widgets" resource.  This does not
   mean that it (for example) doesn't support any HTTP methods; it means
   that the client will need to discover this by interacting with the
   resource, and/or examining the documentation for its link relation
   type.

   Effectively, this names a set of behaviors, as described by a
   resource object, with a link relation type.  This means that several
   link relations might apply to a common base URL; e.g.:

   {
     "resources": {
       "tag:me@example.com,2016:search-by-id": {
         "hrefTemplate": "/search?id={widget_id}",
         "hrefVars": {
           "widget_id": "https://example.org/param/widget_id"
         }
       },
       "tag:me@example.com,2016:search-by-name": {
         "hrefTemplate": "/search?name={widget_name}",
         "hrefVars": {
           "widget_name": "https://example.org/param/widget_name"
         }
       }
     }
   }

   Note that the examples above use both tag [RFC4151] and https
   [RFC7230] URIs; any URI scheme can be used to identify link relations
   and other artefacts in home documents.  Typically, these are not
   links to be followed; they are only used to identify things.

3.  API Objects

   An API Object contains links to information about the API itself.

   Two optional members are defined:

   *  "title" has a string value indicating the name of the API;

   *  "links" has an object value, whose member names are link relation
      types [RFC8288], and values are URLs [RFC3986].  The context of
      these links is the API home document as a whole.

   No links are required to be conveyed, but APIs might benefit from
   setting the following:

   *  author - a suitable URL (e.g., mailto: or https:) for the
      author(s) of the API

   *  describedBy - a link to documentation for the API

   *  license - a link to the legal terms for using the API

   Future members of the API Object MAY be defined by specifications
   that update this document.

4.  Resource Objects

   A Resource Object links to resources of the type indicated in their
   name using one of two mechanisms; either a direct link (in which case
   there is exactly one resource of that relation type associated with
   the API), or a templated link, in which case there are zero to many
   such resources.

   Direct links are indicated with an "href" property, whose value is a
   URI [RFC3986].

   Templated links are indicated with an "hrefTemplate" property, whose
   value is a URI Template [RFC6570].  When "hrefTemplate" is present,
   the Resource Object MUST have a "hrefVars" property; see "Resolving
   Templated Links".

   Resource Objects MUST have exactly one of the "href" or "href-vars"
   properties.

   In both forms, the links that "href" and "hrefTemplate" refer to are
   URI-references [RFC3986] whose base URI is that of the API Home
   Document itself.

   Resource Objects MAY also have a "hints" property, whose value is an
   object that uses HTTP Link Hints (see [I-D.nottingham-link-hint]) as
   its properties.

4.1.  Resolving Templated Links

   A URI can be derived from a Templated Link by treating the
   "hrefTemplate" value as a Level 3 URI Template [RFC6570], using the
   "hrefVars" property to fill the template.

   The "hrefVars" property, in turn, is an object that acts as a mapping
   between variable names available to the template and absolute URIs
   that are used as global identifiers for the semantics and syntax of
   those variables.

   For example, given the following Resource Object:

     "https://example.org/rel/widget": {
       "hrefTemplate": "/widgets/{widget_id}",
       "hrefVars": {
         "widget_id": "https://example.org/param/widget"
       },
       "hints": {
         "allow": ["GET", "PUT", "DELETE", "PATCH"],
         "formats": {
           "application/json": {}
         },
         "acceptPatch": ["application/json-patch+json"],
         "acceptRanges": ["bytes"]
       }
     }

   If you understand that "https://example.org/param/widget" is an
   numeric identifier for a widget, you can then find the resource
   corresponding to widget number 12345 at "https://example.org/
   widgets/12345" (assuming that the Home Document is located at
   "https://example.org/").

5.  Discovering Home Documents

   Home documents are useful starting points for interacting with APIs,
   both for using the API itself and for discovering additional
   information about the API.  Home documents are distinct resources
   with their own URIs, and it is possible that home document resources
   are linked to from other resources, such as from (possibly select)
   resources of the API itself, or from resources that provide API
   directory or discovery services.

   In these cases, the question is how to establish the link to a home
   document.  This specification defines and registers a specific link
   relation type for this purpose, so that links to home documents can
   be made and identified by using this specific link relation type.

5.1.  The "home" Link Relation Type

   The "home" link relation type is used to establish a link to a "home
   document" resource that provides context and/or starting points for
   the context resource.

   The format of the linked home document is not constrained by the
   "home" link relation type.  A home resource can be either machine-
   readable or human-readable, and the "home" link relation type is
   appropriate to link to both kinds of home documents.

6.  Security Considerations

   Clients need to exercise care when using hints.  For example, a naive
   client might send credentials to a server that uses the auth-req
   hint, without checking to see if those credentials are appropriate
   for that server.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Media Type Registration

   TBD

7.2.  Link Relation Type Registration

   This specification registers the "home" link relation type in the
   registry of link relation types [RFC8288].

   *  Relation Name: home

   *  Description: Links to a "home document" resource that provides
      context and/or starting points for the context resource.

   *  Reference: This specification

Appendix B.  Creating and Serving Home Documents

   When making an API home document available, there are a few things to
   keep in mind:

   *  A home document is best located at a memorable URI, because its
      URI will effectively become the URI for the API itself to clients.

   *  Home documents can be personalized, just as "normal" home pages
      can.  For example, you might advertise different URIs, and/or
      different kinds of link relations, depending on the client's
      identity.

   *  Home documents ought to be assigned a freshness lifetime (e.g.,
      "Cache-Control: max-age=3600") so that clients can cache them, to
      avoid having to fetch it every time the client interacts with the
      service.

   *  Custom link relation types, as well as the URIs for variables,
      should lead to documentation for those constructs.

B.1.  Managing Change in Home Documents

   The URIs used in API home documents MAY change over time.  However,
   changing them can cause issues for clients that are relying on cached
   home documents containing old links.

   To mitigate the impact of such changes, servers ought to consider:

   *  Reducing the freshness lifetime of home documents before a link
      change, so that clients are less likely to refer to an "old"
      document.

   *  Regarding the "old" and "new" URIs as equally valid references for
      an "overlap" period.

   *  After that period, handling requests for the "old" URIs
      appropriately; e.g., with a 404 Not Found, or by redirecting the
      client to the new URI.

B.2.  Evolving and Mixing APIs with Home Documents

   Using home documents affords the opportunity to change the "shape" of
   the API over time, without breaking old clients.

   This includes introducing new functions alongside the old ones -- by
   adding new link relation types with corresponding resource objects --
   as well as adding new template variables, media types, and so on.

   It's important to realise that a home document can serve more than
   one "API" at a time; by listing all relevant relation types, it can
   effectively "mix" different APIs, allowing clients to work with
   different resources as they see fit.

Appendix C.  Consuming Home Documents

   Clients might use home documents in a variety of ways.

   In the most common case -- actually consuming the API -- the client
   will scan the Resources Object for the link relation(s) that it is
   interested in, and then to interact with the resource(s) referred to.
   Resource Hints can be used to optimize communication with the client,
   as well as to inform as to the permissible actions (e.g., whether PUT
   is likely to be supported).

   Note that the home document is a "living" document; it does not
   represent a "contract", but rather is expected to be inspected before
   each interaction.  In particular, links from the home document MUST
   NOT be assumed to be valid beyond the freshness lifetime of the home
   document, as per HTTP's caching model [RFC7234].

   As a result, clients ought to cache the home document (as per
   [RFC7234]), to avoid fetching it before every interaction (which
   would otherwise be required).

   Likewise, a client encountering a 404 (Not Found) on a link is
   encouraged obtain a fresh copy of the home document, to assure that
   it is up-to-date.

Appendix D.  Frequently Asked Questions

D.1.  Why not use (insert other service description format)?

   There are a fair number of existing service description formats,
   including those that specialise in "RESTful" interactions.  However,
   these formats generally are optimised for pairwise integration, or
   one-server-to-many-client integration, and less capable of describing
   protocols where both the server and client can evolve and be
   extended.

D.2.  Why doesn't the format allow references or inheritance?

   Adding inheritance or references would allow more modularity in the
   format and make it more compact, at the cost of considerable
   complexity and the associated potential for errors (both in the
   specification and by its users).

   Since good tools and compression are effective ways to achieve the
   same ends, this specification doesn't attempt them.

D.3.  What about "Faults" (i.e., errors)?

   In HTTP, errors are conveyed by HTTP status codes.  While this
   specification could (and even may) allow enumeration of possible
   error conditions, there's a concern that this will encourage
   applications to define many such "faults", leading to tight coupling
   between the application and its clients.  See [RFC7807] for further
   considerations.

D.4.  How Do I find the schema for a format?

   That isn't addressed by home documents.  Ultimately, it's up to the
   media type accepted and generated by resources to define and
   constrain (or not) their syntax.

D.5.  How do I express complex query arguments?

   Complex queries -- i.e., those that exceed the expressive power of
   Link Templates or would require ambiguous properties of a "resources"
   object -- aren't intended to be defined by a home document.  The
   appropriate way to do this is with a "form" language, much as HTML
   defines.

   Note that it is possible to support multiple query syntaxes on the
   same base URL, using more than one link relation type; see the
   example at the start of the document.
