1.  Introduction

   The Tor network [Dingledine2004] has the ability to host network
   services using the ".onion" Special-Use Top-Level Domain.  Such names
   can be used as other domain names would be (e.g., in URLs [RFC3986]),
   but instead of using the DNS infrastructure, .onion names
   functionally correspond to the identity of a given service, thereby
   combining location and authentication.

   .onion names are used to provide access to end to end encrypted,
   secure, anonymized services; that is, the identity and location of
   the server is obscured from the client.  The location of the client
   is obscured from the server.  The identity of the client may or may
   not be disclosed through an optional cryptographic authentication
   process.

   .onion names are self-authenticating, in that they are derived from
   the cryptographic keys used by the server in a client-verifiable
   manner during connection establishment.  As a result, the
   cryptographic label component of a .onion name is not intended to be
   human-meaningful.

   The Tor network is designed to not be subject to any central
   controlling authorities with regards to routing and service
   publication, so .onion names cannot be registered, assigned,
   transferred or revoked.  "Ownership" of a .onion name is derived
   solely from control of a public/private key pair which corresponds to
   the algorithmic derivation of the name.

   In this way, .onion names are "special" in the sense defined by
   [RFC6761] Section 3; they require hardware and software
   implementations to change their handling in order to achieve the
   desired properties of the name (see Section 4).  These differences
   are listed in Section 2.

   Like Top-Level Domain Names, .onion names can have an arbitrary
   number of subdomain components.  This information is not meaningful
   to the Tor protocol, but can be used in application protocols like
   HTTP [RFC7230].

   Note that .onion names are required conform to DNS name syntax (as
   defined in Section 3.5 of [RFC1034] and Section 2.1 of [RFC1123]), as
   they will still be exposed to DNS implementations.

   See [tor-address] and [tor-rendezvous] for the details of the
   creation and use of .onion names.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  The ".onion" Special-Use Domain Name

   These properties have the following effects upon parties using or
   processing .onion names (as per [RFC6761]):

   1.  Users: Human users are expected to recognize .onion names as
       having different security properties (see Section 1), and also as
       being only available through software that is aware of onion
       names.

   2.  Application Software: Applications (including proxies) that
       implement the Tor protocol MUST recognize .onion names as special
       by either accessing them directly, or using a proxy (e.g., SOCKS
       [RFC1928]) to do so.  Applications that do not implement the Tor
       protocol SHOULD generate an error upon the use of .onion, and
       SHOULD NOT perform a DNS lookup.

   3.  Name Resolution APIs and Libraries: Resolvers MUST either respond
       to requests for .onion names by resolving them according to
       [tor-rendezvous] or by responding with NXDOMAIN.

   4.  Caching DNS Servers: Caching servers SHOULD NOT attempt to look
       up records for .onion names.  They MUST generate NXDOMAIN for all
       such queries.

   5.  Authoritative DNS Servers: Authoritative servers MUST respond to
       queries for .onion with NXDOMAIN.

   6.  DNS Server Operators: Operators MUST NOT configure an
       authoritative DNS server to answer queries for .onion.  If they

       do so, client software is likely to ignore any results (see
       above).

   7.  DNS Registries/Registrars: Registrars MUST NOT register .onion
       names; all such requests MUST be denied.

   Note that the restriction upon the registration of .onion names does
   not prohibit IANA from inserting a record into the root zone database
   to reserve the name.

   Likewise, it does not prevent non-DNS service providers (such as
   trust providers) from supporting .onion names in their applications.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers "onion" in the registry of Special-Use Domain
   Names [RFC6761].  See Section 2 for the registration template.

4.  Security Considerations

   The security properties of .onion names can be compromised if, for
   example:

   o  The server "leaks" its identity in another way (e.g., in an
      application-level message), or

   o  The access protocol is implemented or deployed incorrectly, or

   o  The access protocol itself is found to have a flaw.

   Users must take special precautions to ensure that the .onion name
   they are communicating with is the intended one, as attackers may be
   able to find keys which produce service names that are visually or
   semantically similar to the desired service.  This risk is magnified
   because .onion names are typically not human-meaningful.  It can be
   mitigated by generating human meaningful .onion names (at
   considerable computing expense), or through users using bookmarks and
   other trusted stores when following links.

   Also, users need to understand the difference between a .onion name
   used and accessed directly via Tor-capable software, versus .onion
   subdomains of other top-level domain names and providers (e.g., the
   difference between example.onion and example.onion.tld).

   The cryptographic label for a .onion name is constructed by applying
   a function to the public key of the server, the output of which is
   rendered as a string and concatenated with the string ".onion".
   Dependent upon the specifics of the function used, an attacker may be

   able to find a key that produces a collision with the same .onion
   name with substantially less work than a cryptographic attack on the
   full strength key.  If this is possible the attacker may be able to
   impersonate the service on the network.

   A legacy client may inadvertently attempt to resolve a ".onion" name
   through the DNS.  This causes a disclosure that the client is using
   Tor to reach a specific service.  Malicious resolvers could be
   engineered to capture and record such leaks, which might have very
   adverse consequences for the well-being of the Tor user.  This issue
   is mitigated if the client's Tor software is updated to not leak such
   queries, or if the client's DNS software is updated to drop any
   request to the ".onion" TLD.
