<t>This document registers the “.onion” Special-Use Domain Name.</t>

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

<t>The Tor network <xref target="Dingledine2004"/> has the ability to host network services
using the “.onion” Special-Use Top-Level Domain. Such names can be used as
other domain names would be (e.g., in URLs <xref target="RFC3986"/>), but instead of using
the DNS infrastructure, .onion names functionally correspond to the identity of
a given service, thereby combining location and authentication.</t>

<t>.onion names are used to provide access to end to end encrypted, secure,
anonymized services; that is, the identity and location of the server is
obscured from the client. The location of the client is obscured from the
server. The identity of the client may or may not be disclosed through an
optional cryptographic authentication process.</t>

<t>.onion names are self-authenticating, in that they are derived from the
cryptographic keys used by the server in a client-verifiable manner during
connection establishment. As a result, the cryptographic label component of a
.onion name is not intended to be human-meaningful.</t>

<t>The Tor network is designed to not be subject to any central controlling
authorities with regards to routing and service publication, so .onion names
cannot be registered, assigned, transferred or revoked. “Ownership” of a .onion
name is derived solely from control of a public/private key pair which
corresponds to the algorithmic derivation of the name.</t>

<t>In this way, .onion names are “special” in the sense defined by <xref target="RFC6761"/>
Section 3; they require hardware and software implementations to change their
handling in order to achieve the desired properties of the name (see
<xref target="security"/>). These differences are listed in <xref target="onion"/>.</t>

<t>Like Top-Level Domain Names, .onion names can have an arbitrary number of
subdomain components. This information is not meaningful to the Tor protocol,
but can be used in application protocols like HTTP <xref target="RFC7230"/>.</t>

<t>Note that .onion names are required conform to DNS name syntax (as defined in
Section 3.5 of <xref target="RFC1034"/> and Section 2.1 of <xref target="RFC1123"/>), as they will still
be exposed to DNS implementations.</t>

<t>See <xref target="tor-address"/> and <xref target="tor-rendezvous"/> for the details of the creation and
use of .onion names.</t>

<section anchor="notational-conventions" title="Notational Conventions">

<t>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”,
“SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be
interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="onion" title="The “.onion” Special-Use Domain Name">

<t>These properties have the following effects upon parties using or processing
.onion names (as per <xref target="RFC6761"/>):</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>Users: Human users are expected to recognize .onion names as having
different security properties (see <xref target="intro"/>), and also as being only available
through software that is aware of onion names.</t>
  <t>Application Software: Applications (including proxies) that implement the
Tor protocol MUST recognize .onion names as special by either accessing them
directly, or using a proxy (e.g., SOCKS <xref target="RFC1928"/>) to do so. Applications
that do not implement the Tor protocol SHOULD generate an error upon the use of
.onion, and SHOULD NOT perform a DNS lookup.</t>
  <t>Name Resolution APIs and Libraries: Resolvers MUST either respond to
requests for .onion names by resolving them according to <xref target="tor-rendezvous"/> or
by responding with NXDOMAIN.</t>
  <t>Caching DNS Servers: Caching servers SHOULD NOT attempt to look up records
for .onion names. They MUST generate NXDOMAIN for all such queries.</t>
  <t>Authoritative DNS Servers: Authoritative servers MUST respond to queries
for .onion with NXDOMAIN.</t>
  <t>DNS Server Operators: Operators MUST NOT configure an authoritative DNS
server to answer queries for .onion. If they do so, client software is likely
to ignore any results (see above).</t>
  <t>DNS Registries/Registrars: Registrars MUST NOT register .onion names; all
such requests MUST be denied.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Note that the restriction upon the registration of .onion names does not
prohibit IANA from inserting a record into the root zone database to reserve
the name.</t>

<t>Likewise, it does not prevent non-DNS service providers (such as trust
providers) from supporting .onion names in their applications.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="iana-considerations" title="IANA Considerations">

<t>This document registers “onion” in the registry of Special-Use Domain Names
<xref target="RFC6761"/>. See <xref target="onion"/> for the registration template.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">

<t>The security properties of .onion names can be compromised if, for example:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The server “leaks” its identity in another way (e.g., in an application-level message), or</t>
  <t>The access protocol is implemented or deployed incorrectly, or</t>
  <t>The access protocol itself is found to have a flaw.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Users must take special precautions to ensure that the .onion name they are
communicating with is the intended one, as attackers may be able to find keys
which produce service names that are visually or semantically similar to the
desired service. This risk is magnified because .onion names are typically not
human-meaningful. It can be mitigated by generating human meaningful .onion
names (at considerable computing expense), or through users using bookmarks and
other trusted stores when following links.</t>

<t>Also, users need to understand the difference between a .onion name used and
accessed directly via Tor-capable software, versus .onion subdomains of other
top-level domain names and providers (e.g., the difference between
example.onion and example.onion.tld).</t>

<t>The cryptographic label for a .onion name is constructed by applying a
function to the public key of the server, the output of which is rendered
as a string and concatenated with the string “.onion”. Dependent upon the
specifics of the function used, an attacker may be able to find a key that
produces a collision with the same .onion name with substantially less work
than a cryptographic attack on the full strength key. If this is possible the
attacker may be able to impersonate the service on the network.</t>

<t>A legacy client may inadvertently attempt to resolve a “.onion” name through
the DNS. This causes a disclosure that the client is using Tor to reach a
specific service. Malicious resolvers could be engineered to capture and
record such leaks, which might have very adverse consequences for the
well-being of the Tor user. This issue is mitigated if the client’s Tor
software is updated to not leak such queries, or if the client’s DNS
software is updated to drop any request to the “.onion” TLD.</t>
