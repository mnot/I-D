1.  Introduction

   [FETCH] introduces a mechanism whereby HTTP [HTTP] user agents can
   speculatively request a representation of a resource, in order to
   improve perceived performance.

   In some circumstances, a server might have information that leads it
   to believe that sending a full response will not improve performance,
   and could have negative impacts.

   When this happens, it is common practice to use a 503 (Service
   Unavailable) status code.  However, this has been shown to cause
   confusion: a server operator who sees a spike in that status code
   being sent tends to draw the conclusion that there is a server-side
   operational issue.

   While other status codes (e.g., 403 (Forbidden)) could be used, they
   can also suffer (to varying degrees) from the same problem: being
   confused with an error or operational problem.

   This specification defines a new status code to specifically address
   this situation.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  The 4xx (Preliminary Request Denied) Status Code

   The 4xx (Preliminary Request Denied) status code indicates that the
   server is refusing a preliminary request.

   A preliminary request is one that contains a Sec-Purpose header field
   [FETCH] with the value "prefetch".

   This indication is only applicable to the associated request; future
   preliminary requests might or might not succeed.

3.  IANA Considerations

   _TBD_

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [HTTP] and [FETCH] apply.
   Conceivably, the use of this status code could leak information about
   the internal state of the server; caution should be exercised to
   assure that it does not.
