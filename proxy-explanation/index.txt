1.  Introduction

   HTTP requests [RFC7230] to a proxy might not succeed variety of
   reasons; the request itself might violate a policy, or the requested
   content might be deemed unacceptable (e.g., it contains a virus, or
   itself violate a policy being imposed by the proxy).

   For HTTP URLs, information about the reason is often injected into
   the HTTP response, so that the user understands what has happened,
   even if the message is only an HTML "Access Denied."  This practice
   is problematic, because both users and non-browser clients can become
   confused about the source of the information, mistaking content from
   the proxy as being from the origin.

   Furthermore, for HTTPS URLs, there is no way for the proxy to inform
   the end user about its actions.  Proxies could provide HTML content
   in a 403 (Forbidden) response, but browsers are unwilling to show
   this to end users, since doing so would subject them to a potential
   man-in-the-middle attack.

   This specification defines a new response format with a constrained
   vocabulary, so that proxies can communicate basic information about
   why a request has not succeeded, and browsers can provide that
   information to users without risking it being mistaken for an
   authoritative response from the origin server.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  The application/proxy-explanation+json Media Type

   The "application/proxy-explanation+json" media type denotes a JSON
   [RFC7159] format whose root is an object containing the following
   members:

   o  *name* - A short string identifying the party operating the proxy

   o  *title* - A short string title for the explanation

   o  *description* - A string explaining why the request wasn't
      successful

   o  *moreinfo* - A string containing an absolute URL [RFC3986] which
      the user can find relevant information.

   The "name" and "title" members MUST be present; all other members are
   OPTIONAL.

   This media type MUST NOT be generated by origin servers and gateway
   servers (i.e., "reverse proxies" and "content delivery networks"); it
   is only intended to be generated by proxies.  It MAY be generated by
   interception proxies (so-called "transparent proxies"), although as
   per below, it might be ignored by clients in this case.

   It MUST NOT be used with a 2xx or 3xx status code, and clients MUST
   ignore its presence on them.  Typical status codes that it will be
   used with include 403 (Forbidden), 502 (Bad Gateway), and 504
   (Gateway Timeout).

   Proxies SHOULD carefully consider what caching metadata [RFC7234] is
   appropriate to include in such responses.

   Clients MAY selectively support this media type.  For example, an
   implementation might deem it only useful (or safe) in CONNECT
   requests.

   Clients SHOULD indicate that they support this media type by
   including it in the field-value of the Accept request header field
   [RFC7231] of all supported requests.

2.1.  Example

   For example:

       CONNECT www.example.net:80 HTTP/1.1
       Host: www.example.net
       Accept: application/proxy-explanation+json
       Accept-Language: en-us

       HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
       Content-Type: application/proxy-explanation+json
       Cache-Control: no-cache

       {
         "name": "Acme Networks"
         "title": "Policy Violation"
         "description": "This content is above your pay grade."
         "moreinfo": "https://acme.example.com/why"
       }

   A browser might display this to the end user in a manner similar to
   this:

       Policy Violation

       The proxy "Acme Networks" says:

         This content is above your pay grade.

       For more information, see:
         "https://acme.example.com/why?https://www.example.net"

3.  IANA Considerations

   This specification defines a new Internet Media Type [RFC6838]:

   o  Type name: application

   o  Subtype name: proxy-explanation

   o  Required parameters: None

   o  Optional parameters: None; unrecognised parameters should be
      ignored

   o  Encoding considerations: Same as [RFC7159]

   o  Security considerations: See Section 4

   o  Interoperability considerations: None

   o  Published specification: [this document]

   o  Applications that use this media type: HTTP

   o  Fragment identifier considerations: Same as [RFC7159]

   o  Additional information:

      *  Deprecated alias names for this type: N/A

      *  Magic number(s): N/A

      *  File extension(s): N/A

      *  Macintosh file type code(s): N/A

   o  Person & email address to contact for further information: Mark
      Nottingham mnot@mnot.net [4]

   o  Intended usage: COMMON

   o  Restrictions on usage: N/A

   o  Author: Mark Nottingham mnot@mnot.net [5]

   o  Change controller: IESG

4.  Security Considerations

   The approach taken in this specification precludes a proxy presenting
   itself as the origin, provided that, when presented to the user, the
   information is sufficiently contextualised as being from the proxy.

   This approach does not preclude an origin server presenting itself as
   a the proxy, in cases where the client supports the media type on
   requests other than CONNECT.
