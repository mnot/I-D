1.  Introduction

   HTTP intermediaries - including both forward proxies and gateways
   (also known as "reverse proxies") - have become an increasingly
   significant part of HTTP deployments.  In particular, reverse proxies
   and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) form part of the critical
   infrastructure of many Web sites.

   Typically, HTTP intermediaries forward requests towards the origin
   server and then forward their responses back to clients.  However, if
   an error occurs, the response is generated by the intermediary
   itself.

   HTTP accommodates these types of errors with a few status codes; for
   example, 502 Bad Gateway and 504 Gateway Timeout.  However,
   experience has shown that more information is necessary to aid
   debugging and communicate what's happened to the client.

   To address this, Section 2 defines a new HTTP response header field
   to convey such information, using the Proxy Status Types defined in
   Section 3.  Section 4 explains how to define new Proxy Status Types.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This specification uses Structured Headers
   [I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure] to specify syntax.  The terms sh-
   param-list, sh-item, sh-string, sh-token and sh-integer refer to the
   structured types defined therein.

   Note that in this specification, "proxy" is used to indicate both
   forward and reverse proxies, otherwise known as gateways.  "Next hop"
   indicates the connection in the direction leading to the origin
   server for the request.

2.  The Proxy-Status HTTP Header Field

   The Proxy-Status HTTP response header field allows an intermediary to
   indicate the nature and details of an error condition it encounters
   when servicing a request.

   It is a Structured Headers [I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure]
   Parameterised List, where each item in the list indicates an error
   condition.  Typically, it will have only one param-item (the error
   condition that triggered generation of the response it occurs
   within), but more than one value is not prohibited.

   Each param-item's primary-id is a Proxy Status Type, a registered
   value that indicates the nature of the error.

   Each param-item can have zero to many parameters.  Section 2.1 lists
   parameters that can be used with all Proxy Status Types; individual
   types can define additional parameters to use with them.  All
   parameters are optional; see Section 6 for their potential security
   impact.

   For example:

   HTTP/1.1 504 Gateway Timeout
   Proxy-Status: connection_timeout; proxy=SomeCDN; origin=abc; tries=3

   indicates the specific nature of the timeout as a connect timeout to
   the origin with the identifier "abc", and that is was generated by
   the intermediary that identifies itself as "FooCDN."  Furthermore,
   three connection attempts were made.

Internet-Draft                Proxy-Status                 February 2019


   Or:

   HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
   Proxy-Status: http_request_error; proxy=SomeReverseProxy

   indicates that this 429 Too Many Requests response was generated by
   the intermediary, not the origin.

   Each Proxy Status Type has a Recommended HTTP Status Code.  When
   generating a HTTP response containing Proxy-Status, its HTTP status
   code SHOULD be set to the Recommended HTTP Status Code.  However,
   there may be circumstances (e.g., for backwards compatibility with
   previous behaviours) when another status code might be used.

   Section 3 lists the Proxy Status Types defined in this document; new
   ones can be defined using the procedure outlined in Section 4.

   Proxy-Status MAY be sent in HTTP trailers, but - as with all trailers
   - it might be silently discarded along the path to the user agent,
   this SHOULD NOT be done unless it is not possible to send it in
   headers.  For example, if an intermediary is streaming a response and
   the upstream connection suddenly terminates, Proxy-Status can be
   appended to the trailers of the outgoing message (since the headers
   have already been sent).

   Note that there are various security considerations for
   intermediaries using the Proxy-Status header field; see Section 6.

   Origin servers MUST NOT generate the Proxy-Status header field.

2.1.  Generic Proxy Status Parameters

   This section lists parameters that are potentially applicable to most
   Proxy Status Types.

   o  proxy - a sh-token identifying the HTTP intermediary generating
      this response.

   o  origin - a sh-token identifying the origin server whose behaviour
      triggered this response.

   o  protocol - a sh-token indicating the ALPN protocol identifier
      [RFC7301] used to connect to the next hop.  This is only
      applicable when that connection was actually established.

   o  tries - a sh-integer indicating the number of times that the error
      has occurred before this response.

   o  details - a sh-string containing additional information not
      captured anywhere else.  This can include implementation-specific
      or deployment-specific information.

   o  Extra Parameters: None.

   o  Recommended HTTP status code: 500

3.28.  TLS Rejected Proxy Certificate

   o  Name: tls_rejected_proxy_certificate

   o  Description: The next hop rejected client certificate provided by
      the intermediary during TLS handshake.

   o  Extra Parameters: None.

   o  Recommended HTTP status code: 500

3.29.  TLS Error

   o  Name: tls_error

      *  alert_message: a sh-token containing the applicable description
         string from the TLS Alerts registry.

   o  Recommended HTTP status code: 502

3.30.  Proxy Internal Error

   o  Name: proxy_internal_error

   o  Description: The intermediary encountered an internal error
      unrelated to the origin.

   o  Extra Parameters:

      *  details: a sh-string containing details about the error
         condition.

   o  Recommended HTTP status code: 500

3.31.  HTTP Request Error

   o  Name: http_request_error

   o  Description: The intermediary is generating a client (4xx)
      response on the origin's behalf.  Applicable status codes include
      (but are not limited to) 400, 403, 405, 406, 408, 411, 413, 414,
      415, 416, 417, 429.  This proxy status type helps distinguish
      between responses generated by intermediaries from those generated
      by the origin.

   o  Extra Parameters: None.

   o  Recommended HTTP status code: The applicable 4xx status code

4.  Defining New Proxy Status Types

   New Proxy Status Types can be defined by registering them in the HTTP
   Proxy Status Types registry.

   Registration requests are reviewed and approved by a Designated
   Expert, as per [RFC8126] Section 4.5.  A specification document is
   appreciated, but not required.

   The Expert(s) should consider the following factors when evaluating
   requests:

   o  Community feedback

   o  If the value is sufficiently well-defined

   o  If the value is generic; vendor-specific, application-specific and
      deployment-specific values are discouraged

   Registration requests should use the following template:

   o  Name: [a name for the Proxy Status Type that is allowable as a sh-
      param-list key]

   o  Description: [a description of the conditions that generate the
      Proxy Status Types]

   o  Extra Parameters: [zero or more optional parameters, typed using
      one of the types available in sh-item]

   o  Recommended HTTP status code: [the appropriate HTTP status code
      for this entry]

   See the registry at https://iana.org/assignments/http-proxy-statuses
   [4] for details on where to send registration requests.

5.  IANA Considerations

   Upon publication, please create the HTTP Proxy Status Types registry
   at https://iana.org/assignments/http-proxy-statuses [5] and populate
   it with the types defined in Section 3; see Section 4 for its
   associated procedures.

6.  Security Considerations

   One of the primary security concerns when using Proxy-Status is
   leaking information that might aid an attacker.

   As a result, care needs to be taken when deciding to generate a
   Proxy-Status header.  Note that intermediaries are not required to
   generate a Proxy-Status header field in any response, and can
   conditionally generate them based upon request attributes (e.g.,
   authentication tokens, IP address).

   Likewise, generation of all parameters is optional.

   Special care needs to be taken in generating proxy and origin
   parameters, as they can expose information about the intermediary's
   configuration and back-end topology.
