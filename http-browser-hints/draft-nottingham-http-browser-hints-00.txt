                 draft-nottingham-http-browser-hints-00

Abstract

   Over time, Web browsers have adapted how they use HTTP based upon
   common server configurations and behaviours.  While this is necessary
   in the common case, it can be detrimental for performance and
   interoperability.

   This document establishes a mechanism whereby origin servers can make
   available hints for browsers about their preferences and
   capabilities, without imposing overhead on their interactions or
   requiring support for them.

   This is intended to allow browsers to safely optimise connections to
   servers.

Internet-Draft             HTTP Browser Hints                   May 2011


1.  Introduction

   HTTP [RFC2616] clients -- especially browsers -- typically use
   hardcoded values or heuristics to determine how many TCP connections
   to use to a server, based on common-case server behaviours and
   limitations.

   Likewise, they often send voluminous request headers (e.g., in User-
   Agent and Allow) because they fear that changing those headers'
   values will break some sites that depend upon specific values.

   These are just two examples of common, conservative behaviour by
   browsers that is good for interoperability, but potentially bad for
   performance in certain circumstances.

   This memo proposes a mechanism whereby a HTTP server can advertise
   hints for browsers (and other clients), so that communication with
   them can be optimised.

   It does so by defining a file format for such Browser Hints
   Section 3, and defining how clients can discover it for a given Web
   site Section 4.  Finally, an extensible vocabulary of hints is
   defined Section 5.

   Feedback for this draft should take place on the
   apps-discuss@ietf.org mailing list.


2.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  A file format for Browser Hints

   Browser hints are indicating using a JSON [RFC4627] formatted file,
   containing a single object whose member's names are browser hints, as
   defined by the registry Section 8.2.

   For example;

             {
             "max-conns": 5,
             "small-hdrs": true
             }

Internet-Draft             HTTP Browser Hints                   May 2011


   By their nature, all browser hints are optional; i.e., browsers are
   free to ignore them.


4.  Discovering Browser Hints for a Web site

   The hints relevant to a given site can be determined by fetching the
   URI path "/.well-known/browser-hints" for that site.

   Typically, clients (especially browsers) will not block other
   requests to a site while fetching the browser hints (because they're
   optional); instead, it will usually be done concurrently with other
   requests, or on idle connections for future use.

   In this specification, "site" is scoped by the URI scheme and
   authority.  As such, all of the following are considered to be
   different sites, and therefore have different browser hints:

   o  http://foo.com/
   o  https://foo.com/
   o  http://foo.com:8000/
   o  http://www.foo.com/

   Clients SHOULD follow HTTP 3xx redirects when retrieving hints.

   A successful response is valid for its associated site for as long as
   it can be cached in HTTP.

   If the response has a 200 status code but no explicit freshness
   (e.g., a Cache-Control: max-age or Expires: header), browsers SHOULD
   cache the response heuristically for a generous fixed period (e.g.,
   30 days).


5.  Pre-defined Browser Hints

5.1.  max-conns

   o  Browser Hint Name: max-conns
   o  Description: When present, this hint indicates the maximum number
      of concurrent persistent connections that the site would like
      clients to use.
   o  Value Type: number
   o  Contact: mnot@mnot.net

5.2.  pconn-ip

   o  Browser Hint Name: pconn-ip
   o  Description: When true, this hint indicates that the site allows
      clients to reuse persistent connections keyed by IP address,
      rather than by hostname.  Note that all sites that are sharing the
      connection MUST declare this hint for it to be used, and if a
      transport-layer certificate is in use (e.g., for TLS [RFC5246]),
      it MUST be valid for all sites.
   o  Value Type: true | false
   o  Contact: mnot@mnot.net
   o  Specification: [this document]

   In other words, if both www.example.com and foo.example.org resolve
   to the address 192.0.2.5, and indicate this hint, then clients can
   send a request to www.example.com and then a request to
   foo.example.org on the same TCP connection to that address.

   If any of the sites grouped together for the purposes of pconn-ip
   declare a max-conns hint, the max-conns value for that address is
   considered to be the maximum of the declared max-conn hints present.

5.3.  max-pipeline-depth

   o  Browser Hint Name: max-pipeline-depth
   o  Description: When present, this hint indicates the maximum number
      of pipelined requests per connection that the site would like
      clients to use.
   o  Value Type: number
   o  Contact: mnot@mnot.net

5.4.  small-hdrs

   o  Browser Hint Name: small-hdrs
   o  Description: When true, this hint indicates that clients can omit
      the Accept and Accept-Charset request headers when communicating
      with the site, and that they can use a shortened version of the
      User-Agent header.
   o  Value Type: true | false
   o  Contact: mnot@mnot.net

5.5.  no-referer

   o  Browser Hint Name: no-referer
   o  Description: When true, this hint indicates that clients can omit
      the Referer HTTP request header when sending requests to the site.

Internet-Draft             HTTP Browser Hints                   May 2011


   o  Value Type: true | false
   o  Contact: mnot@mnot.net

5.6.  send-ref

   o  Browser Hint Name: send-ref
   o  Description: When true, this hint indicates that clients can omit
      the Referer HTTP request header when sending requests to the site,
      if they instead send a Ref HTTP request header (see Section 6).
   o  Value Type: true | false
   o  Contact: mnot@mnot.net


6.  The Ref HTTP Request Header

   TBD: relative URI referer header


7.  Security Considerations

   TBD


8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  The 'browser-hints' Well-Known URI

   This document defines the "browser-hints" Well-Known URI [RFC5785].

   o  URI suffix: browser-hints
   o  Change controller: mnot@mnot.net
   o  Specification document(s): [this document]
   o  Related information:

8.2.  The HTTP Browser Hints Registry

   This document establishes the HTTP Browser Hints Registry.

   New hints are registered First Come First Served (see [RFC5226]), by
   sending e-mail to <mailto:iana@iana.org> (or using other mechanisms,
   as established by IANA).

   Registration requests MUST use the following template:

   o  Browser Hint Name: [name of hint]
   o  Description: [description of hint]

Internet-Draft             HTTP Browser Hints                   May 2011


   o  Value Type: [JSON value type]
   o  Contact: [e-mail address(es)]
   o  Specification: [optional; reference or URI to more info]

   New hints MUST be optional; they cannot place requirements upon
   implementations.

   Likewise, new hints MUST be relevant to browser use cases; other non-
   browsing hints and metadata would make the hints response undesirably
   large.  However, note that non-browser clients MAY use them.

   Finally, new hints MUST NOT make communication non-conformant with
   HTTP itself; i.e., this is not a mechanism for changing the HTTP
   protocol in incompatible ways.  For example, if a hint indicates that
   browsers can compress request headers using GZIP, intermediaries that
   are interposed are likely to fail.

   The initial contents of the registry are defined in Section 5.
