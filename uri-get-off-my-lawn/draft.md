--- abstract

It is sometimes attractive to specify a particular structure for URIs (or parts thereof) to
add support for a new feature, application or facility. This memo provides guidelines for 
such situations in standards documents.

Introduction
============

URIs {{RFC3986}} very often include structure and application data. This might include
artifacts from filesystems (often occurring in the path component), user information (often
in the query component) and application data throughout. In some cases, there can even be
application-specific data in the authority component (e.g., some applications are spread
across several hostnames to enable a form of partitioning or dispatch).

Such conventions for the structure of URIs can be imposed by an implementation; for
example, many Web servers use the filename extension of the last path segment to determine
the media type of the response. Likewise, pre-packaged applications often have highly
structured URIs that can only be changed in limited ways (often, just the hostname and port
they are deployed upon).

When such conventions are mandated by standards, however, it can have several potentially
detrimental effects:

* Collisions - As more conventions for URI structure become standardised, it becomes more
  likely that there will be collisions between such conventions (especially considering
  that servers, applications and individual deployments will have their own conventions).

* Dilution - Adorning URIs with extra information to support new standard features dilutes
  their usefulness as identifiers when that information is ephemeral (as URIs ought to be
  stable; see {{webarch}} Section 3.5.1), or its inclusion causes several
  alternate forms of the URI to exist (see {{webarch}} Section 2.3.1).

* Operational Difficulty - Supporting some URI conventions can be difficult in
  some implementations. For example, specifying that a particular query parameter be used
  preclude the use of Web servers that serve the response from a filesystem.

* Client Assumptions - When conventions are standardised, some clients will inevitably
  assume that the standards are in use when they are seen. This can lead to
  interoperability problems.

At a more philosophical level, the structure of a URI needs to be firmly under the control
of a single party; its owner. Standardising parts of a URI's structure usurps that control;
see {{webarch}} Section 2.2.2.1 for more information.

This memo explains best current practices for establishing URI structures, conventions and formats in
specifications; in particular, IETF specifications, although they are more broadly applicable. It
also offers strategies for specifications to avoid violating these guidelines in {{alternatives}}.


Notational Conventions
----------------------

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in {{RFC2119}}.

Best Current Practices for Standardising Structured URIs
=======================================================

These guidelines target a few different types of specifications:

* URI Scheme Definitions ("scheme definitions") - specifications that define and register URI schemes,
  as per {{RFC4395}}.

* Protocol Extensions ("extensions") - specifications that offer new capabilities to
  potentially any identifier, or a large subset; e.g., a new signature mechanism for HTTP
  URIs, or metadata for any URI.

* Applications Using URIs ("applications") - specifications that use URIs to meet specific
  needs; e.g., a HTTP interface to particular information on a host.

Requirements that target the generic class "Specifications" apply to all standards, including both those enumerated above above and others. They are also applicable to non-standard RFC publications.

Note that this specification ought not be interpreted as preventing the allocation of control of URIs
by parties that legitimately own them, or have delegated that ownership; for example, a specification
might legitimately specify the semantics of a URI on the IANA.ORG Web site as part of the
establishment of a registry.


URI Schemes
-----------

Applications and extensions MAY require use of specific URI scheme(s); for example, it is perfectly
acceptable to require that an application support HTTP and HTTPS URIs. However, applications SHOULD
NOT preclude the use of other URI schemes in the future, to promote reuse, unless they are clearly
specific to the nominated schemes.

Specifications MUST NOT define substructure within URI schemes, unless they do so by
modifying {{RFC4395}}, or they are the registration document for the URI scheme(s) in question.


URI Authorities
---------------

Scheme definitions define the presence, format and semantics of an authority component in
URIs; all other specifications MUST NOT constrain, define structure or semantics for them.


URI Paths
---------

Scheme definitions define the presence, format, and semantics of a path component in URIs; all
other specifications MUST NOT constrain, define structure or semantics for them.

The only exception to this requirement is registered "well-known" URIs, as specified by {{RFC5785}}.


URI Queries
-----------

The presence, format and semantics of the query component of URIs is dependent upon many factors, and
MAY be constrained by a scheme definition. Often, they are determined by the implementation of a
resource itself.

Applications SHOULD NOT directly specify the syntax of queries, as this can cause operational difficulties for deployments that do not support a particular form of a query. 

Extensions MUST NOT specify the format or semantics of queries. In particular, extensions MUST NOT
assume that all HTTP(S) resources are capable of accepting queries in the format defined by
{{HTML4}}, Section 17.13.4.


URI Fragment Identifiers
------------------------

Media type definitions (as per {{RFC6838}} SHOULD specify the fragment identifier
syntax(es) to be used with them; other specifications MUST NOT define structure within the
fragment identifier, unless they are explicitly defining one for reuse by media type
definitions.


Alternatives to Specifying Static URIs {#alternatives}
======================================

Given the issues above, the most successful strategy for applications and extensions that wish to use
URIs is to use them in the fashion they were designed; as run-time artifacts that are exchanged as
part of the protocol, rather than statically specified syntax.

For example, if a specific URI needs to be known to interact with an application, its "shape" can be
determined by interacting with the application's more general interface (in Web terms, its "home
page") to learn about that URI.

{{RFC5988}} describes a framework for identifying the semantics of a link in a "link relation type"
to aid this. {{RFC6570}} provides a standard syntax for "link templates" that can be used to
dynamically insert application-specific variables into a URI to enable such applications while
avoiding impinging upon URI owners' control of them.

{{RFC5785}} allows specific paths to be 'reserved' for standard use on URI schemes that opt into that
mechanism (HTTP and HTTPS by default). Note, however, that this is not a general "escape valve" for
applications that need structured URIs; see that specification for more information.


Security Considerations
=======================

This memo does not introduce new protocol artifacts with security considerations.
