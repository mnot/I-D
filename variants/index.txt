                      draft-nottingham-variants-02

Abstract

   This specification introduces an alternative way to communicate a
   secondary cache key for a HTTP resource, using the HTTP "Variants"
   and "Variant-Key" response header fields.  Its aim is to make HTTP
   proactive content negotiation more cache-friendly.

1.  Introduction

   HTTP proactive content negotiation ([RFC7231], Section 3.4.1) is
   seeing renewed interest, both for existing request headers like
   Content-Language and for newer ones (for example, see
   [I-D.ietf-httpbis-client-hints]).

   Successfully reusing negotiated responses that have been stored in a
   HTTP cache requires establishment of a secondary cache key
   ([RFC7234], Section 4.1).  Currently, the Vary header ([RFC7231],
   Section 7.1.4) does this by nominating a set of request headers.

   HTTP's caching model allows a certain amount of latitude in
   normalising those request header field values, so as to increase the
   chances of a cache hit while still respecting the semantics of that
   header.  However, normalisation is not formally defined, leading to
   divergence in cache behaviours.

   Even when the headers' semantics are understood, a cache does not
   know enough about the possible alternative representations available
   on the origin server to make an appropriate decision.

   For example, if a cache has stored the following request/response
   pair:

   GET /clancy HTTP/1.1
   Host: www.example.com
   Accept-Language: en;q=1.0, fr;q=0.5

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: text/html
   Content-Language: fr
   Vary: Accept-Language
   Transfer-Encoding: chunked

   [French content]

   Provided that the cache has full knowledge of the semantics of
   Accept-Language and Content-Language, it will know that a French
   representation is available and might be able to infer that an
   English representation is not available.  But, it does not know (for
   example) whether a Japanese representation is available without
   making another request, incurring possibly unnecessary latency.

   This specification introduces the HTTP Variants response header field
   (Section 2) to enumerate the available variant representations on the

   origin server, to provide clients and caches with enough information
   to properly satisfy requests - either by selecting a response from
   cache or by forwarding the request towards the origin - by following
   the algorithm defined in Section 5.

   Its companion the Variant-Key response header field (Section 3)
   indicates which representation was selected, so that it can be
   reliably reused in the future.  When this specification is in use,
   the example above might become:

   GET /clancy HTTP/1.1
   Host: www.example.com
   Accept-Language: en;q=1.0, fr;q=0.5

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: text/html
   Content-Language: fr
   Vary: Accept-Language
   Variants: Accept-Language;fr;de;en;jp
   Variant-Key: fr
   Transfer-Encoding: chunked

   [French content]

   Proactive content negotiation mechanisms that wish to be used with
   Variants need to define how to do so explicitly; see Section 4.  As a
   result, it is best suited for negotiation over request headers that
   are well-understood.

   Variants also works best when content negotiation takes place over a
   constrained set of representations; since each variant needs to be
   listed in the header field, it is ill-suited for open-ended sets of
   representations.

   Variants can be seen as a simpler version of the Alternates header
   field introduced by [RFC2295]; unlike that mechanism, Variants does
   not require specification of each combination of attributes, and does
   not assume that each combination has a unique URL.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   notation of [RFC5234] with a list extension, defined in Section 7 of
   [RFC7230], that allows for compact definition of comma-separated
   lists using a '#' operator (similar to how the '*' operator indicates
   repetition).

   Additionally, it uses the "field-name", "OWS" and "token" rules from
   [RFC7230].

2.  The "Variants" HTTP Header Field

   The Variants HTTP response header field indicates what
   representations are available for a given resource at the time that
   the response is produced, by enumerating the request header fields
   that it varies on, along with the values that are available for each.

   Variants        = 1#variant-item
   variant-item    = field-name *( OWS ";" OWS available-value )
   available-value = token

   Each "variant-item" indicates a request header field that carries a
   value that clients might proactively negotiate for; each parameter on
   it indicates a value for which there is an available representation
   on the origin server.

   So, given this example header field:

   Variants: Accept-Encoding;gzip

   a recipient can infer that the only content-coding available for that
   resource is "gzip" (along with the "identity" non-encoding; see
   Appendix A.2).

   Given:

   Variants: accept-encoding

   a recipient can infer that no content-codings (beyond identity) are
   supported.  Note that as always, field-name is case-insensitive.

   A more complex example:

   Variants: Accept-Encoding;gzip;br, Accept-Language;en ;fr

   Here, recipients can infer that two content-codings in addition to
   "identity" are available, as well as two content languages.  Note
   that, as with all HTTP header fields that use the "#" list rule (see




Nottingham               Expires August 17, 2018                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft        HTTP Representation Variants         February 2018


   [RFC7230], Section 7), they might occur in the same header field or
   separately, like this:

   Variants: Accept-Encoding;gzip;brotli
   Variants: Accept-Language;en ;fr

   The ordering of available-values after the field-name is significant,
   as it might be used by the header's algorithm for selecting a
   response (in this example, the first language is the default; see
   Appendix A.3).

   The ordering of the request header fields themselves indicates
   descending application of preferences; in the example above, a cache
   that has all of the possible permutations stored will honour the
   client's preferences for Accept-Encoding before honouring Accept-
   Language.

   Origin servers SHOULD consistently send Variant header fields on all
   cacheable (as per [RFC7234], Section 3) responses for a resource,
   since its absence will trigger caches to fall back to Vary
   processing.

   Likewise, servers MUST send the Variant-Key response header field
   when sending Variants, since its absence means that the stored
   response will not be reused when this specification is implemented.

2.1.  Relationship to Vary

   Caches that implement this specification SHOULD ignore request header
   fields in the Vary header for the purposes of secondary cache key
   calculation ([RFC7234], Section 4.1) when their semantics are
   implemented as per this specification and their corresponding
   response header field is listed in Variants.

   If any member of the Vary header does not have a corresponding
   variant that is understood by the implementation, it is still subject
   to the requirements there.

   See Section 6.3 for an example.

   In practice, implementation of Vary varies considerably.  As a
   result, cache efficiency might drop considerably when Variants does
   not contain all of the headers referenced by Vary, because some
   implementations might choose to disable Variants processing when this
   is the case.

3.  The "Variant-Key" HTTP Header Field

   The Variant-Key HTTP response header field is used to indicate the
   value(s) from the Variants header field that identify the
   representation it occurs within.

   Variant-Key     = 1#available-value

   Each value indicates the selected available-value, in the same order
   as the variants listed in the Variants header field.

   Therefore, Variant-Key MUST be the same length (in comma-separated
   members) as Variants, and each member MUST correspond in position to
   its companion in Variants.

   For example:

   Variants: Content-Encoding;gzip;br, Content-Language;en ;fr
   Variant-Key: gzip, fr

   This header pair indicates that the representation has a "gzip"
   content-coding and "fr" content-language.

   Note that Variant-Key is only used to indicate what request
   attributes are associated with the response containing it; this is
   different from headers like Content-Encoding, which indicate
   attributes of the response itself.  In the example above, it might be
   that a gzip'd version of the French content is not available, in
   which case the response will include:

   Variant-Key: gzip, fr

   even though Content-Encoding does not contain "gzip".

3.1.  Generating a Normalised Variant-Key

   This algorithm generates a normalised string for Variant-Key,
   suitable for comparison with values generated by Section 5.

   Given stored-headers, a set of headers from a stored response, a
   normalised variant-key for that message can be generated by:

   1.  Let variant-key-header be a string, the result of selecting all
       field-values of stored-headers whose field-name is "Variant-Key"
       and joining them with a comma (",").

   2.  Remove all whitespace from variant-key-header.

Internet-Draft        HTTP Representation Variants         February 2018


   3.  Return variant-key-header.

4.  Defining Content Negotiation Using Variants

   To be usable with Variants, proactive content negotiation mechanisms
   need to be specified to take advantage of it.  Specifically, they:

   o  MUST define a request header field that advertises the clients
      preferences or capabilities, whose field-name SHOULD begin with
      "Accept-".

   o  MUST define the syntax of available-values that will occur in
      Variants and Variant-Key.

   o  MUST define an algorithm for selecting a result.  It MUST return a
      list of available-values that are suitable for the request, in
      order of preference, given the value of the request header
      nominated above and an available-values list from the Variants
      header.  If the result is an empty list, it implies that the cache
      cannot satisfy the request.

   Appendix A fulfils these requirements for some existing proactive
   content negotiation mechanisms in HTTP.

5.  Cache Behaviour

   Caches that implement the Variants header field and the relevant
   semantics of the field-name it contains can use that knowledge to
   either select an appropriate stored representation, or forward the
   request if no appropriate representation is stored.

   They do so by running this algorithm (or its functional equivalent)
   upon receiving a request:

   Given incoming-request, a mapping of field-names to lists of field
   values, and stored-responses, a list of stored responses suitable for
   reuse as defined in [RFC7234] Section 4, excepting the requirement to
   calculate a secondary cache key:

   1.  If stored-responses is empty, return an empty list.

   2.  Order stored-responses by the "Date" header field, most recent to
       least recent.

   3.  Let sorted-variants be an empty list.

   4.  If the freshest member of stored-responses (as per [RFC7234],
       Section 4.2) has one or more "Variants" header field(s):



Nottingham               Expires August 17, 2018                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft        HTTP Representation Variants         February 2018


       1.  Select one member of stored-responses and let its "Variants"
           header field-value(s) be variants-header.  This SHOULD be the
           most recent response, but MAY be from an older one as long as
           it is still fresh.

       2.  For each variant in variants-header:

           1.  If variant's field-name corresponds to the request header
               field identified by a content negotiation mechanism that
               the implementation supports:

               1.  Let request-value be the field-value(s) associated
                   with field-name in incoming-request.

               2.  Let available-values be a list containing all
                   available-value for variant.

               3.  Let sorted-values be the result of running the
                   algorithm defined by the content negotiation
                   mechanism with request-value and available-values.

               4.  Append sorted-values to sorted-variants.

           At this point, sorted-variants will be a list of lists, each
           member of the top-level list corresponding to a variant-item
           in the Variants header field-value, containing zero or more
           items indicating available-values that are acceptable to the
           client, in order of preference, greatest to least.

   5.  Return result of running Find Available Keys (Section 5.1) on
       sorted-variants, an empty string and an empty list.

   This returns a list of strings suitable for comparing to normalised
   Variant-Keys (Section 3.1) that represent possible responses on the
   server that can be used to satisfy the request, in preference order,
   provided that their secondary cache key (after removing the headers
   covered by Variants) matches.  Section 5.2 illustrates one way to do
   this.

5.1.  Find Available Keys

   Given sorted-variants, a list of lists, and key-stub, a string
   representing a partial key, and possible-keys, a list:

   1.  Let sorted-values be the first member of sorted-variants.

   2.  For each sorted-value in sorted-values:

Internet-Draft        HTTP Representation Variants         February 2018


       1.  If key-stub is an empty string, let this-key be a copy of
           sorted-value.

       2.  Otherwise:

           1.  Let this-key be a copy of key-stub.

           2.  Append a comma (",") to this-key.

           3.  Append sorted-value to this-key.

       3.  Let remaining-variants be a copy of all of the members of
           sorted-variants except the first.

       4.  If remaining-variants is empty, append this-key to possible-
           keys.

       5.  Otherwise, run Find Available Keys on remaining-variants,
           this-key and possible-keys.

   3.  Return possible-keys.

5.2.  Check Vary

   This algorithm is an example of how an implementation can meet the
   requirement to apply the members of the Vary header field that are
   not covered by Variants.

   Given a stored response, stored-response:

   1.  Let filtered-vary be the field-value(s) of stored-response's
       "Vary" header field.

   2.  Let processed-variants be a list containing the request header
       fields that identify the content negotiation mechanisms supported
       by the implementation.

   3.  Remove any member of filtered-vary that is a case-insensitive
       match for a member of processed-variants.

   4.  If the secondary cache key (as calculated in [RFC7234],
       Section 4.1) for stored_response matches incoming-request, using
       filtered-vary for the value of the "Vary" response header, return
       True.

   5.  Return False.

Internet-Draft        HTTP Representation Variants         February 2018


   This returns a Boolean that indicates whether stored-response can be
   used to satisfy the request.

   Note that implementation of the Vary header field varies in practice,
   and the algorithm above illustrates only one way to apply it.  It is
   equally viable to forward the request if there is a request header
   listed in Vary but not Variants.

5.3.  Example of Cache Behaviour

   For example, if the selected variants-header was:

   Variants: Accept-Language;en;fr,de, Accept-Encoding;gzip,br

   and the request contained the headers:

   Accept-Language: fr;q=1.0, en;q=0.1
   Accept-Encoding: gzip

   Then the sorted-variants would be:

 [
   ["fr", "en"]           // prefers French, will accept English
   ["gzip", "identity"]   // prefers gzip encoding, will accept identity
 ]

   Which means that the sorted-keys would be:

   [
     'fr gzip',
     'fr identity',
     'en gzip',
     'en identity'
   ]

   Representing a first preference of a French, gzip'd response.  Thus,
   if a cache has a response with:

   Variant-Key: fr, gzip

   it could be used to satisfy the first preference.  If not, responses
   corresponding to the other keys could be returned, or the request
   could be forwarded towards the origin.

6.  Example Headers

6.1.  Single Variant

   Given a request/response pair:

   GET /foo HTTP/1.1
   Host: www.example.com
   Accept-Language: en;q=1.0, fr;q=0.5

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: image/gif
   Content-Language: en
   Cache-Control: max-age=3600
   Variants: Content-Language;en;de
   Variant-Key: en
   Vary: Accept-Language
   Transfer-Encoding: chunked

   Upon receipt of this response, the cache knows that two
   representations of this resource are available, one with a Content-
   Language of "en", and another whose Content-Language is "de".

   Subsequent requests (while this response is fresh) will cause the
   cache to either reuse this response or forward the request, depending
   on what the selection algorithm determines.

   So, if a request with "en" in Accept-Language is received and its
   q-value indicates that it is acceptable, the stored response is used.
   A request that indicates that "de" is acceptable will be forwarded to
   the origin, thereby populating the cache.  A cache receiving a
   request that indicates both languages are acceptable will use the
   q-value to make a determination of what response to return.

   A cache receiving a request that does not list either language as
   acceptable (or does not contain an Accept-Language at all) will
   return the "en" representation (possibly fetching it from the
   origin), since it is listed first in the Variants list.

   Note that Accept-Language is listed in Vary, to assure backwards-
   compatibility with caches that do not support Variants.

6.2.  Multiple Variants

   A more complicated request/response pair:

   GET /bar HTTP/1.1
   Host: www.example.net
   Accept-Language: en;q=1.0, fr;q=0.5
   Accept-Encoding: gzip, br

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: image/gif
   Content-Language: en
   Content-Encoding: br
   Variants: Content-Language;en;jp;de
   Variants: Content-Encoding;br;gzip
   Variant-Key: en, br
   Vary: Accept-Language, Accept-Encoding
   Transfer-Encoding: chunked

   Here, the cache knows that there are two axes that the response
   varies upon; Content-Language and Content-Encoding.  Thus, there are
   a total of nine possible representations for the resource (including
   the identity encoding), and the cache needs to consider the selection
   algorithms for both axes.

   Upon a subsequent request, if both selection algorithms return a
   stored representation, it can be served from cache; otherwise, the
   request will need to be forwarded to origin.

6.3.  Partial Coverage

   Now, consider the previous example, but where only one of the Vary'd
   axes is listed in Variants:

   GET /bar HTTP/1.1
   Host: www.example.net
   Accept-Language: en;q=1.0, fr;q=0.5
   Accept-Encoding: gzip, br

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: image/gif
   Content-Language: en
   Content-Encoding: br
   Variants: Content-Encoding;br;gzip
   Variant-Key: br
   Vary: Accept-Language, Accept-Encoding
   Transfer-Encoding: chunked

   Here, the cache will need to calculate a secondary cache key as per
   [RFC7234], Section 4.1 - but considering only Accept-Language to be
   in its field-value - and then continue processing Variants for the
   set of stored responses that the algorithm described there selects.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This specification registers two values in the Permanent Message
   Header Field Names registry established by [RFC3864]:

   o  Header field name: Variants

   o  Applicable protocol: http

   o  Status: standard

   o  Author/Change Controller: IETF

   o  Specification document(s): [this document]

   o  Related information:

   o  Header field name: Variant-Key

   o  Applicable protocol: http

   o  Status: standard

   o  Author/Change Controller: IETF

   o  Specification document(s): [this document]

   o  Related information:

8.  Security Considerations

   If the number or advertised characteristics of the representations
   available for a resource are considered sensitive, the Variants
   header by its nature will leak them.

   Note that the Variants header is not a commitment to make
   representations of a certain nature available; the runtime behaviour
   of the server always overrides hints like Variants.

9.  Acknowledgments

   This protocol is conceptually similar to, but simpler than,
   Transparent Content Negotiation [RFC2295].  Thanks to its authors for
   their inspiration.

   It is also a generalisation of a Fastly VCL feature designed by
   Rogier 'DocWilco' Mulhuijzen.

Appendix A.  Variants for Existing Content Negotiation Mechanisms

   This appendix defines the required information to use existing
   proactive content negotiation mechanisms (as defined in [RFC7231],
   Section 5.3) with the Variants header field.

A.1.  Accept

   This section defines handling for Accept variants, as per [RFC7231]
   Section 5.3.2.

   To perform content negotiation for Accept given a request-value and
   available-values:

   1.  Let preferred-available be an empty list.

   2.  Let preferred-types be a list of the types in the request-value,
       ordered by their weight, highest to lowest, as per [RFC7231]
       Section 5.3.2 (omitting any coding with a weight of 0).  If
       "Accept" is not present or empty, preferred-types will be empty.
       If a type lacks an explicit weight, an implementation MAY assign
       one.

   3.  If the first member of available-values is not a member of
       preferred-types, append it to preferred-types (thus making it the
       default).

   4.  For each preferred-type in preferred-types:

       1.  If any member of available-values matches preferred-type,
           using the media-range matching mechanism specified in



Nottingham               Expires August 17, 2018               [Page 16]

Internet-Draft        HTTP Representation Variants         February 2018


           [RFC7231] Section 5.3.2 (which is case-insensitive), append
           those members of available-values to preferred-available
           (preserving the precedence order implied by the media ranges'
           specificity).

   5.  Return preferred-available.

   Note that this algorithm explicitly ignores extension parameters on
   media types (e.g., "charset").

A.2.  Accept-Encoding

   This section defines handling for Accept-Encoding variants, as per
   [RFC7231] Section 5.3.4.

   To perform content negotiation for Accept-Encoding given a request-
   value and available-values:

   1.  Let preferred-available be an empty list.

   2.  Let preferred-codings be a list of the codings in the request-
       value, ordered by their weight, highest to lowest, as per
       [RFC7231] Section 5.3.1 (omitting any coding with a weight of 0).
       If "Accept-Encoding" is not present or empty, preferred-codings
       will be empty.  If a coding lacks an explicit weight, an
       implementation MAY assign one.

   3.  If "identity" is not a member of preferred-codings, append
       "identity".

   4.  Append "identity" to available-values.

   5.  For each preferred-coding in preferred-codings:

       1.  If there is a case-insensitive, character-for-character match
           for preferred-coding in available-values, append that member
           of available-values to preferred-available.

   6.  Return preferred-available.

   Note that the unencoded variant needs to have a Variant-Key header
   field with a value of "identity".

A.3.  Accept-Language

   This section defines handling for Accept-Language variants, as per
   [RFC7231] Section 5.3.5.

Internet-Draft        HTTP Representation Variants         February 2018


   To perform content negotiation for Accept-Language given a request-
   value and available-values:

   1.  Let preferred-available be an empty list.

   2.  Let preferred-langs be a list of the language-ranges in the
       request-value, ordered by their weight, highest to lowest, as per
       [RFC7231] Section 5.3.1 (omitting any language-range with a
       weight of 0).  If a language-range lacks a weight, an
       implementation MAY assign one.

   3.  If the first member of available-values is not a member of
       preferred-langs, append it to preferred-langs (thus making it the
       default).

   4.  For each preferred-lang in preferred-langs:

       1.  If any member of available-values matches preferred-lang,
           using either the Basic or Extended Filtering scheme defined
           in [RFC4647] Section 3.3, append those members of available-
           values to preferred-available (preserving their order).

   5.  Return preferred-available.
