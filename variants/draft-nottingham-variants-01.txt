1.  Introduction

   HTTP proactive content negotiation ([RFC7231], Section 3.4.1) is
   starting to be used more widely again.  The most widely seen use -
   determining a response's content-coding - is being joined by renewed
   interest in negotiation for language and other, newer attributes (for
   example, see [I-D.ietf-httpbis-client-hints]).

   Successfully reusing negotiated responses that have been stored in a
   HTTP cache requires establishment of a secondary cache key



Nottingham                Expires April 6, 2018                 [Page 2]

Internet-Draft                HTTP Variants                 October 2017


   ([RFC7234], Section 4.1) using the Vary header ([RFC7231],
   Section 7.1.4), which identifies the request headers that form the
   secondary cache key for a given response.

   HTTP's caching model allows a certain amount of latitude in
   normalising request header fields to match those stored in the cache,
   so as to increase the chances of a cache hit while still respecting
   the semantics of that header.  However, this is often inadequate;
   even with understanding of the headers' semantics to facilitate such
   normalisation, a cache does not know enough about the possible
   alternative representations available on the origin server to make an
   appropriate decision.

   For example, if a cache has stored the following request/response
   pair:

   GET /foo HTTP/1.1
   Host: www.example.com
   Accept-Language: en;q=1.0, fr;q=0.5

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: text/html
   Content-Language: fr
   Vary: Accept-Language
   Transfer-Encoding: chunked

   [French content]

   Provided that the cache has full knowledge of the semantics of
   "Accept-Language" and "Content-Language", it will know that a French
   representation is available and might be able to infer that an
   English representation is not available.  But, it does not know (for
   example) whether a Japanese representation is available without
   making another request, thereby incurring possibly unnecessary
   latency.

   This specification introduces the HTTP "Variants" response header
   field to enumerate the available variant representations on the
   origin server, to provide clients and caches with enough information
   to properly satisfy requests - either by selecting a response from
   cache or by forwarding the request towards the origin.

   "Variants" is best used when content negotiation takes place over a
   constrained set of representations; since each variant needs to be
   listed in the header field, it is ill-suited for open-ended sets of
   representations.  Likewise, it works best for content negotiation
   over header fields whose semantics are well-understood, since it
   requires a selection algorithm to be specified ahead of time.

Internet-Draft                HTTP Variants                 October 2017


1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   notation of [RFC5234] with a list extension, defined in Section 7 of
   [RFC7230], that allows for compact definition of comma-separated
   lists using a '#' operator (similar to how the '*' operator indicates
   repetition).

   Additionally, it uses the "field-name", "OWS" and "token" rules from
   [RFC7230].

2.  The "Variants" HTTP Header Field

   The "Variant" HTTP response header field is used to indicate what
   other representations are available for a given resource at the time
   that the response is produced.

   Variants        = 1#variant
   variant         = field-name *( OWS ";" OWS available-value )
   available-value = token

   Each "variant" indicates a response header field that carries a value
   that clients might proactively negotiate for; each parameter on it
   indicates a value for which there is an available representation on
   the origin server.

   So, given this example header field:

   Variants: Content-Encoding;gzip

   a recipient can infer that the only content-coding available for that
   resource is "gzip" (along with the "identity" non-encoding; see
   {{content-encoding}).

   Given:

   Variants: content-encoding

   a recipient can infer that no content-codings are supported.  Note
   that as always with header field names, it is case-insensitive.

   A more complex example:



Nottingham                Expires April 6, 2018                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                HTTP Variants                 October 2017


   Variants: Content-Encoding;gzip;brotli, Content-Language;en ;fr

   Here, recipients can infer that two Content-Encodings are available,
   as well as two content languages.  Note that, as with all HTTP header
   fields that use the "#" list rule (see [RFC7230], Section 7), they
   might occur in the same header field or separately, like this:

   Variants: Content-Encoding;gzip;brotli
   Variants: Content-Language;en ;fr

   The ordering of available-values after the field-name is significant,
   as it might be used by the header's algorithm for selecting a
   response.

   Senders SHOULD consistently send "Variant" header fields on all
   cacheable (as per [RFC7234], Section 3) responses for a resource,
   since its absence will trigger caches to fall back to "Vary"
   processing.

   Likewise, servers MUST send the "Content-*" response headers
   nominated by "Variants" when sending that header.

2.1.  Defining Content Negotiation Using Variants

   To be usable with Variants, proactive content negotiation mechanisms
   need to be specified to take advantage of it.  Specifically, they:

   o  MUST define a request header field that advertises the clients
      preferences or capabilities, whose field-name SHOULD begin with
      "Accept-".

   o  MUST define a response header field that indicates the result of
      selection, whose field-name SHOULD begin with "Content-" and whose
      field-value SHOULD be a token.

   o  MUST define an algorithm for selecting a result.  It MUST return
      an ordered list of selected responses, given the incoming request,
      a list of selected responses, and the list of available values
      from "Variants".  If the result is an empty list, it implies that
      the cache does not contain an appropriate response.

   Appendix A fulfils these requirements for some existing proactive
   content negotiation mechanisms in HTTP.

   Note that unlike Vary, Variants does not use stored request headers
   to help select a response; this is why defining a response header to
   aid identification and selection is required.

2.2.  Cache Behaviour

   Caches that implement the "Variants" header field and the relevant
   semantics of the field-name it contains can use that knowledge to
   either select an appropriate stored representation, or forward the
   request if no appropriate representation is stored.

   They do so by running this algorithm (or its functional equivalent)
   upon receiving a request, "incoming-request":

   1.  Let "selected-responses" be a list of the stored responses
       suitable for reuse as defined in [RFC7234] Section 4, excepting
       the requirement to calculate a secondary cache key.

   2.  Order "selected-responses" by the "Date" header field, most
       recent to least recent.

   3.  If the freshest (as per [RFC7234], Section 4.2) has one or more
       "Variants" header field(s):

       1.  Select one member of "selected-responses" and let its
           "Variants" header field-value(s) be "Variants".  This SHOULD
           be the most recent response, but MAY be from an older one as
           long as it is still fresh.

       2.  For each "variant" in "Variants":

           1.  If the "field-name" corresponds to the response header
               field identified by a content negotiation mechanism that
               the implementation supports:

               1.  Let "available-values" be a list containing all
                   "available-value" for the "variant".

               2.  Let "selected-responses" be the result of running the
                   algorithm defined by the content negotiation
                   mechanism with "incoming-request", "selected-
                   responses" and "available-values".

               3.  For the purposes of selecting a response, ignore the
                   content negotiation's identified request header
                   field-name in the "Vary" header field of each member
                   of "selected-responses", if present.

   4.  Process any member of "selected-responses" that has a "Vary"
       response header field whose field-value still contains one or
       more "field-name"s, removing that members if it does not match
       (as per [RFC7234], Section 4.1).

Internet-Draft                HTTP Variants                 October 2017


   5.  Return the first member of "selected-responses".  If "selected-
       responses" is empty, return "null".

   This algorithm will either return the appropriate stored response to
   use, or "null" if the cache needs to forward the request towards the
   origin server.

2.2.1.  Relationship to Vary

   Caches that fully implement this specification MUST ignore request
   header-fields in the "Vary" header for the purposes of secondary
   cache key calculation ([RFC7234], Section 4.1) when their semantics
   are understood, implemented as per this specification, and their
   corresponding response header field is listed in "Variants".

   Request header fields listed in "Vary" that are not implemented in
   terms of this specification or not present in the "Variants" field
   SHOULD still form part of the secondary cache key.

   The algorithm in Section 2.2 implements these requirements.

2.3.  Examples

2.3.1.  Single Variant

   Given a request/response pair:

   GET /foo HTTP/1.1
   Host: www.example.com
   Accept-Language: en;q=1.0, fr;q=0.5

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: image/gif
   Content-Language: en
   Cache-Control: max-age=3600
   Variants: Content-Language;en;de
   Vary: Accept-Language
   Transfer-Encoding: chunked

   Upon receipt of this response, the cache knows that two
   representations of this resource are available, one with a "Content-
   Language" of "en", and another whose "Content-Language" is "de".

   Subsequent requests (while this response is fresh) will cause the
   cache to either reuse this response or forward the request, depending
   on what the selection algorithm "Accept-Language" and "Content-
   Language" determines.




Nottingham                Expires April 6, 2018                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                HTTP Variants                 October 2017


   So, a request with "en" in "Accept-Language" is received and its
   q-value indicates that it is acceptable, the stored response is used.
   A request that indicates that "de" is acceptable will be forwarded to
   the origin, thereby populating the cache.  A cache receiving a
   request that indicates both languages are acceptable will use the
   q-value to make a determination of what response to return.

   A cache receiving a request that does not list either language as
   acceptable (or does not contain an Accept-Language at all) will
   return the "en" representation (possibly fetching it from the
   origin), since it is listed first in the "Variants" list.

   Note that "Accept-Language" is listed in Vary, to assure backwards-
   compatibility with caches that do not support "Variants".

   Also, note that is is the response header which is listed in
   Variants, not the request header (the opposite of Vary).

2.3.2.  Multiple Variants

   A more complicated request/response pair:

   GET /bar HTTP/1.1
   Host: www.example.net
   Accept-Language: en;q=1.0, fr;q=0.5
   Accept-Encoding: gzip, br

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: image/gif
   Content-Language: en
   Content-Encoding: br
   Variants: Content-Language;en;jp;de
   Variants: Content-Encoding;br;gzip
   Vary: Accept-Language, Accept-Encoding
   Transfer-Encoding: chunked

   Here, the cache knows that there are two axes that the response
   varies upon; "Content-Language" and "Content-Encoding".  Thus, there
   are a total of six possible representations for the resource, and the
   cache needs to consider the selection algorithms for both axes.

   Upon a subsequent request, if both selection algorithms return a
   stored representation, it can be served from cache; otherwise, the
   request will need to be forwarded to origin.

Internet-Draft                HTTP Variants                 October 2017


2.3.3.  Partial Coverage

   Now, consider the previous example, but where only one of the varied
   axes is listed in "Variants":

   GET /bar HTTP/1.1
   Host: www.example.net
   Accept-Language: en;q=1.0, fr;q=0.5
   Accept-Encoding: gzip, br

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: image/gif
   Content-Language: en
   Content-Encoding: br
   Variants: Content-Encoding;br;gzip
   Vary: Accept-Language, Accept-Encoding
   Transfer-Encoding: chunked

   Here, the cache will need to calculate a secondary cache key as per
   [RFC7234], Section 4.1 - but considering only "Accept-Language" to be
   in its field-value - and then continue processing "Variants" for the
   set of stored responses that the algorithm described there selects.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This specification registers one value in the Permanent Message
   Header Field Names registry established by [RFC3864]:

   o  Header field name: Variants

   o  Applicable protocol: http

   o  Status: standard

   o  Author/Change Controller: IETF

   o  Specification document(s): [this document]

   o  Related information:

4.  Security Considerations

   If the number or advertised characteristics of the representations
   available for a resource are considered sensitive, the "Variants"
   header by its nature will leak them.

Internet-Draft                HTTP Variants                 October 2017


   Note that the "Variants" header is not a commitment to make
   representations of a certain nature available; the runtime behaviour
   of the server always overrides hints like "Variants".

5.  Acknowledgments

   This protocol is conceptually similar to, but simpler than,
   Transparent Content Negotiation [RFC2295].  Thanks to its authors for
   their inspiration.

   It is also a generalisation of a Fastly VCL feature designed by
   Rogier 'DocWilco' Mulhuijzen.

   Thanks to Hooman Beheshti for his review and input.

Appendix A.  Variants and Defined Content Negotiation Mechanisms

   This appendix defines the required information to use existing
   proactive content negotiation mechanisms (as defined in [RFC7231],
   Section 5.3) with the "Variants" header field.

A.1.  Content-Encoding

   When negotiating for the "Content-Encoding" response header field's
   value, the applicable request header field is "Accept-Encoding", as
   per [RFC7231] Section 5.3.4.

   To perform content negotiation for Content-Encoding given an
   "incoming-request", "stored-responses" and "available-values":

   1.  Let "preferred-codings" be a list of the "coding"s in the
       "Accept-Encoding" header field of "incoming-request", ordered by
       their "weight", highest to lowest.  If "Accept-Encoding" is not
       present or empty, "preferred-codings" will be empty.

   2.  If "identity" is not a member of "preferred-codings", append
       "identity" to "preferred-codings" with a "weight" of 0.001.

   3.  Remove any member of "preferred-codings" whose "weight" is 0.

   4.  Append "identity" to "available-values".

   5.  Remove any member of "available-values" not present in
       "preferred-codings", comparing in a case-insensitive fashion.

   6.  Let "filtered-responses" be an empty list.

   7.  For each "available-value" of "available-values":

       1.  If there is a member of "stored-responses" whose "Content-
           Encoding" field-value has "content-coding"s ([RFC7231],
           Section 3.1.2.2) that all match members of "available-value"
           in a case-insensitive fashion, append that stored response to
           "filtered-responses".

   8.  If there is a member of "stored-responses" that does not have a
       "Content-Encoding" header field, append that stored response to
       "filtered-responses".

   9.  Return "filtered-responses".

   This algorithm selects the stored response(s) in order of preference
   by the client; if none are stored in cache, the request will be
   forwarded towards the origin.  It defaults to the "identity" non-
   encoding.

   Implementations MAY remove members of "filtered-responses" based upon
   their "weight" or other criteria before returning.  For example, they
   might wish to return an empty list when the client's most-preferred
   available response is not stored, so as to populate the cache as well
   as honour the client's preferences.

A.2.  Content-Language

   When negotiating for the "Content-Language" response header field's
   value, the applicable request header field is "Accept-Language", as
   per [RFC7231] Section 5.3.5.

   To perform content negotiation for Content-Language given an
   "incoming-request", "stored-responses" and "available-values":

   1.  Let "preferred-langs" be a list of the "language-range"s in the
       "Accept-Language" header field ([RFC7231], Section 5.3.5) of
       "incoming-request", ordered by their "weight", highest to lowest.

   2.  If "preferred-langs" is empty, append "*" with a "weight" of
       0.001.

   3.  Remove any member of "preferred-langs" whose "weight" is 0.

   4.  Filter "available-values" using "preferred-langs" with either the
       Basic Filtering scheme defined in [RFC4647] Section 3.3.1, or the

       Lookup scheme defined in Section 3.4 of that document.  Use the
       first member of "available-values" as the default.

   5.  Let "filtered-responses" be an empty list.

   6.  For each "available-value" of "available-values":

       1.  If there is a member of "stored-responses" whose "Content-
           Language" field-value has a "language-tag" ([RFC7231],
           Section 3.1.3.2) that matches "available-value" in a case-
           insensitive fashion, append that stored response to
           "filtered-responses".

   7.  Return "filtered-responses".

   This algorithm selects the available response(s) (according to
   "Variants") in order of preference by the client; if none are stored
   in cache, the request will be forwarded towards the origin.  If no
   preferred language can be selected, the first "available-value" will
   be used as the default.

   Implementations MAY remove members of "filtered-responses" based upon
   their "weight" or other criteria before returning.  For example, they
   might wish to return an empty list when the client's most-preferred
   available response is not stored, so as to populate the cache as well
   as honour the client's preferences.
