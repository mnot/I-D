    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

      <t>Many protocols make use of points of extensibility that use
      constants to identify various protocol parameters. To ensure that the
      values used in these fields do not have conflicting uses, and to promote
      interoperability, their allocation is often coordinated by a central
      authority. For IETF protocols, that role is filled by the Internet
      Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) <xref target="RFC2860"/>. </t>

      <t>The Protocol field in the IP header <xref target="RFC0791"/> and
      MIME media types <xref target="RFC4288"/> are two examples of such
      coordinations.</t>

      <t>In this document, we call the range of possible values for such a
      field a "namespace". The binding or association of a specific value with
      a particular purpose within a namespace is called an assignment (or,
      variously: an assigned number, assigned value, "code point", "protocol
      constant", or "protocol parameter"). The act of assignment is called a
      registration, and it takes place in the context of a registry.</t>

      <t>To manage a given namespace prudently, IANA needs guidance
      describing the conditions under which new values should be assigned, as
      well as when and how modifications to existing values can be made. This
      document defines a framework for the documentation of these guidelines
      by specification authors, in order to assure that the guidance given to
      IANA is clear and addresses the various issues that are likely in the
      operation of a registry.</t>

      <t>Typically, this information is recorded in a dedicated section of
      the specification with the title "IANA Considerations".</t>

      <section title="Terminology Used In This Document">

        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
        NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
        this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <xref
        target="RFC2119"/>. For this document, "the specification" as used by
        RFC 2119 refers to the processing of protocol documents within the
        IETF standards process.</t>

      </section>
    </section>


    <section anchor="creating" title="Creating and Revising Registries">

      <t>Defining a registry involves describing the namespace(s) to be
      created, listing an initial set of assignments (if appropriate), and
      documenting guidelines on how future assignments are to be made. </t>

      <t>Before defining a registry, however, consider delegating the
      namespace in some manner. This route should be pursued when appropriate,
      as it lessens the burden on IANA for dealing with assignments. </t>

      <t>In particular, not all namespaces require a registry; in some cases,
      assignments can be made independently and with no further (central)
      coordination. In the Domain Name System, for example, IANA only deals
      with assignments at the higher levels, while subdomains are administered
      by the organization to which the space has been delegated. When a
      namespace is delegated in this manner, the scope of IANA is limited to
      the parts of the namespace where IANA has authority.</t>

      <section anchor="what-to-put" title="Documentation Requirements for Registries">

        <t>Documents that create a new namespace (or modify the definition of
        an existing space) and that expect IANA to play a role in maintaining
        that space (serving as a repository for registered values) MUST
        provide clear instructions on details of the namespace, either in the
        IANA Considerations section, or referenced from it.</t>

        <t>In particular, such instructions MUST include:

          <list style="hanging">

            <t hangText="The name of the registry (or sub-registry)"><vspace
            blankLines="1"/> This name will appear on the IANA web page and
            will be referred to in future documents that need to allocate a
            value from the new space. The full name (and abbreviation, if
            appropriate) should be provided. It is highly desirable that the
            chosen name not be easily confused with the name of another
            registry.
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            When creating a sub-registry, the registry that it is a part of
            must be identified using its full name.
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            Providing a URL to precisely identify the registry helps IANA
            understand the request. Such URLs are usually removed from the RFC
            prior to final publication.
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>
            For example, a document could contain something like this:
              <list style="empty"><t>
              [TO BE REMOVED: This registration should be made in the Foobar
              Operational Parameters registry, located at

            </t>

            <t hangText="Required information for registrations"><vspace
            blankLines="1"/> This information may include the need to document
            relevant Security Considerations, if any.</t>

            (e.g., valid ranges for integers, length limitations on strings,
            etc.) as well as the exact format in which registry values should
            be displayed. For numeric assignments, one should specify whether
            values are to be recorded in decimal, hexadecimal, or some other
            format. For strings, the encoding format should be specified
            (ASCII, UTF8, etc.). </t>

            <t hangText="Initial assignments and reservations"><vspace
            blankLines="1"/>Any initial assignments or registrations to be

            indicated.</t>

    X. IANA Considerations

    This document defines a new DHCP option, entitled "FooBar" (see
    Section y), assigned a value of TBD1 from the DHCP Option space
    [to be removed upon publication:
    http://www.iana.org/assignments/bootp-dhcp-parameters]
    [RFC2132] [RFC2939]:
                                   Data
          Tag     Name            Length      Meaning

          TBD1    FooBar          N           FooBar server

    The FooBar option also defines an 8-bit FooType field, for which
    IANA is to create and maintain a new sub-registry entitled
    "FooType values" under the FooBar option.  Initial values for the
    DHCP FooBar FooType registry are given below; future assignments
    are to be made through Expert Review [BCP26].
    Assignments consist of a DHCP FooBar FooType name and its
    associated value.

      </section>

      <section anchor="selecting-policy" title="Defining an Appropriate Registry Policy">

        <t>There are several issues to consider when defining the policy for
        the management of a registry.</t>

        <t>If the registry's namespace is limited, assignments will need to
        be made carefully to prevent exhaustion.</t>

        <t>Even when the space is essentially unlimited, however, it is
        usually desirable to have at least a minimal review prior to
        assignment in order to: <list style="symbols">

            <t>prevent the hoarding of or unnecessary wasting of values. For
            example, if the space consists of text strings, it may be
            desirable to prevent entities from obtaining large sets of strings
            that correspond to desirable names (existing company names, for
            example). </t>

            <t>provide a sanity check that the request actually makes sense
            and is necessary. Experience has shown that some level of minimal
            review from a subject matter expert is useful to prevent
            assignments in cases where the request is malformed or not
            actually needed (for example, an existing assignment for an
            essentially equivalent service already exists). </t>

          </list></t>

        <t>Perhaps most importantly, unreviewed extensions can impact
        interoperability and security. See <xref target='RFC6709' />. </t>

        <t>When the namespace is essentially unlimited and there are no
        potential interoperability or security issues, assigned numbers can
        usually be given out to anyone without any subjective review. In such
        cases, IANA can make assignments directly, provided that IANA is given
        detailed instructions on what types of requests it should grant, and
        it is able to do so without exercising subjective judgement.</t>

        <t>When this is not the case, some level of review is required.
        However, it's important to balance adequate review and ease of
        registration. In many cases, those making registrations will not be
        IETF participants; requests often come from other standards
        organizations, from organizations not directly involved in standards,
        from ad-hoc community work (from an open-source project, for example),
        and so on. Registration must not be unnecessarily difficult,
        unnecessarily costly (in terms of time and other resources), nor
        unnecessarily subject to denial.</t>

        <t>While it is sometimes necessary to restrict what gets registered
        (e.g., for limited resources such as bits in a byte, or for items for
        which unsupported values can be damaging to protocol operation), in
        many cases having what's in use represented in the registry is more
        important. Overly strict review criteria and excessive cost (in time
        and effort) discourage people from even attempting to make a
        registration. If a registry fails to reflect the protocol elements
        actually in use, it can adversely affect deployment of protocols on
        the Internet, and the registry itself is devalued.</t>

        <t>In particular, when a registry policy that requires involvement of
        Working Groups, directorates, or other bodies to be actively involved
        and to support the effort, requests frequently run into concerns that
        "it's not worth doing a Standards-Track RFC for something this
        trivial," when, in fact, that requirement was created by the Working
        Group in the first place, by placing the bar that high.</t>

        <t>Therefore, Working Groups and other document developers should use
        care in selecting appropriate registration policies when their
        documents create registries. They should select the least strict
        policy that suits a registry's needs, and look for specific
        justification for policies that require significant community
        involvement (Specification Required, in terms of the well-known
        policies).</t>

        <section title="Using the Well-Known Registration Policies">

          <t>This document defines a number of registration policies in <xref
          target="well-known"/>. Because they benefit from both community
          experience and wide understanding, their use is encouraged when
          appropriate.</t>

          <t>It is also acceptable to cite one of the well-known policies and
          include additional guidelines for what kind of considerations should
          be taken into account by the review process.</t>

          <t>For example, RADIUS <xref target="RFC3575"/> specifies the use of
          a Designated Expert, but includes specific additional criteria the
          Designated Expert should follow.</t>

          <t> The well-known policies from "First Come First Served" to
          "Standards Action" specify a range of policies in increasing order
          of strictness: </t>

          <t><list style="hanging" hangIndent="5">

              <t hangText="4. ">First Come First Served<vspace/>
                No review, minimal documentation.</t>

              <t hangText="5. ">Expert Review<vspace/>
                Expert review, sufficient documentation for review.</t>

              <t hangText="6. ">Specification Required<vspace/>
                Expert review, significant, stable public documentation.</t>

              <t hangText="7. ">RFC Required<vspace/>

              <t hangText="8. ">IETF Review<vspace/>
                RFC publication, IETF Stream only, but need not be Standards Track.</t>

              <t hangText="9. ">Standards Action<vspace/>
                RFC publication, IETF Stream, Standards Track only.</t>

            </list></t>

          <t> Examples of situations that might merit RFC Required, IETF
          Review, or Standards Action include the following: <list
          style="symbols">

            <t>When a resource is limited, such as bits in a byte (or in two
            bytes, or four), or numbers in a limited range. In these cases,
            allowing registrations that haven't been carefully reviewed and
            agreed by community consensus could too quickly deplete the
            allowable values.</t>

            <t>When thorough community review is necessary to avoid extending
            or modifying the protocol in ways that could be damaging. One
            example is in defining new command codes, as opposed to options
            that use existing command codes: the former might require a strict
            policy, where a more relaxed policy could be adequate for the
            latter. Another example is in defining protocol elements that
            change the semantics of existing operations.</t>

          </list></t>

          <t>The description in <xref target="policy-iesg"/> of "IESG
          Approval" suggests that the IESG "can (and should) reject a request
          if another path for registration is available that is more
          appropriate and there is no compelling reason not to use that path."
          The IESG should give similar consideration to any registration
          policy more stringent than Specification Required, asking for
          justification and ensuring that more relaxed policies have been
          considered, and the strict policy is the right one.</t>

          <t>Accordingly, document developers need to anticipate this and
          document their considerations for selecting the specified policy
          (ideally, in the document itself; failing that, in the shepherd
          writeup). Likewise, the document shepherd should ensure that the
          selected policies have been justified before sending the document to
          the IESG.</t>

          <t>When specifications are revised, registration policies should be
          reviewed in light of experience since the policies were set.</t>

          <t>Note that the well-known policies are not exclusive; there are
          situations where a different policy might be more appropriate.</t>

        <section anchor="multiple-policies" title="Using Multiple Policies in Combination">

          <t>In some situations, it is necessary to define multiple processes.
          For example, registrations through the normal IETF process might
          have one, and registrations from outside the process to have a
          different policy applied.</t>

          <t>Thus, a particular registry might want to use a policy such as
          "RFC Required" or "IETF Review" sometimes, with a designated expert
          checking a "Specification Required" policy at other times. </t>

          <t>This can be documented in the IANA Considerations section when
          the registry is created:

             <list style="empty"><t>
               IANA is asked to create the registry "Fruit Access Flags" as a
               sub-registry of "Fruit Parameters". New registrations will be
               permitted through either the IETF Review policy or the
               Specification Required policy [BCP26].
               </t></list>
           </t>

           <t>Such combinations will commonly use one of {Standards Action,
           IETF Review, RFC Required} in combination with one of
           {Specification Required, Expert Review}.</t>

        <t>Updating the registration process for an already existing
        (previously created) namespace (whether created explicitly or
        implicitly) follows a process similar to that used when creating a new
        namespace. That is, a document is produced that makes reference to the
        existing namespace and then provides detailed guidelines for handling
        assignments in each individual namespace. Such documents are normally
        processed as Best Current Practices (BCPs) <xref target="RFC2026"/>.
        </t>

        <t>Example documents that updated the guidelines for managing (then)
        pre-existing registries include: <xref target="RFC6195"/>, <xref
        target="RFC3228"/>, and <xref target="RFC3575"/>.</t>

    <section anchor="existing" title="Registering New Values in an Existing Registry">
      <section anchor="put-in-existing" title="Documentation Requirements for Registrations">

        <t>Often, documents request an assignment from an already existing
        namespace (one created by a previously published document).</t>

        <t>Such documents should clearly identify the namespace in which each
        value is to be registered. If the registration goes into a
        sub-registry, the author should clearly describe where the assignment
        or registration should go. Use the exact namespace name as listed on
        the IANA web page, and cite the RFC where the namespace is defined.
        </t>

        <t>There is no need to mention what the assignment policy for new
        assignments is, as that should be clear from the references.</t>

        <t>When referring to an existing registry, providing a URL to
        precisely identify the registry is helpful. Such URLs, however, should
        usually be removed from the RFC prior to final publication, since IANA
        URLs are not guaranteed to be stable in the future. In cases where it
        is important to include a URL in the document, IANA should concur on
        its inclusion. </t>

        <t>For example, a document could contain something like this:
          <list style="empty"><t>
          [TO BE REMOVED: This registration should be made in the Foobar Operational Parameters
          registry, located at http://www.iana.org/assignments/foobar-registry]
          </t></list>
        </t>

        <t>Each value requested should be given a unique reference. When the
        value is numeric, use the notation: TBD1, TBD2, etc. Throughout the
        document where an actual IANA-assigned value should be filled in, use
        the "TBDx" notation. This helps ensure that the final RFC has the
        correct assigned values inserted in all of the relevant places where
        the value is expected to appear in the final document. For values that
        are text strings, a specific name can be suggested. IANA will normally
        assign the name, unless it conflicts with a name already in use. </t>

        <t>Normally, the values to be used are chosen by IANA and documents
        should specify values of "TBD". However, in some cases, a value may
        have been used for testing or in early implementations. In such cases,
        it is acceptable to include text suggesting what specific value should
        be used (together with the reason for the choice). For example, one
        might include the text "the value XXX is suggested as it is used in
        implementations". However, it should be noted that suggested values
        are just that; IANA will attempt to assign them, but may find that
        impossible, if the proposed number has already been assigned for some
        other use. </t>

        <t>For some registries, IANA has a long-standing policy prohibiting
        assignment of names or codes on a vanity or organization-name basis.
        For example, codes are always assigned sequentially unless there is a
        strong reason for making an exception. Nothing in this document is
        intended to change those policies or prevent their future application.
        </t>

        <t>The IANA Considerations section should summarize all of the IANA
        actions, with pointers to the relevant sections elsewhere in the
        document as appropriate. When multiple values are requested, it is
        generally helpful to include a summary table. It is also helpful for
        this table to be in the same format as it appears or will appear on
        the IANA web site. For example:
        <vspace blankLines="1"/>
        <figure><artwork>
  Value     Description          Reference
  --------  -------------------  ---------
  TBD1      Foobar               [[this RFC]]
        </artwork></figure>
        <vspace blankLines="1"/>
          Note: In cases where authors feel that including the full table is
          too verbose or repetitive, authors should still include the table in the draft,
          but may include a note asking that the table be removed prior to
          publication of the final RFC.
        </t>
        
        <t>As an example, the following text could be used to request
        assignment of a DHCPv6 option number: <list>

            <t>IANA has assigned an option code value of TBD1 to the DNS
            Recursive Name Server option and an option code value of TBD2 to
            the Domain Search List option from the DHCP option code space
            defined in Section 24.3 of RFC 3315. </t>

        <t>
   Even after a number has been assigned, some types of registrations contain
   additional information that may need to be updated over time.
      </t>
      <t>
   For example, MIME media types, character sets, and language tags typically
   include more information than just the registered value itself, and may
   need things such as point-of-contact information, security issues, pointers
   to updates, or literature references updated.
      </t>
      <t>
   In such cases, the document defining the namespace must clearly state who
   is responsible for maintaining and updating a registration. Depending on
   the registry, it may be appropriate to specify one or more of:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
        Letting registrants and/or nominated change controllers update their

        Designating the IESG, a designated expert, or another entity as having

        make necessary updates.

        <t>
   Experience has shown that the documented IANA considerations for individual
   protocols do not always adequately cover the reality of registry operation,
   or are not sufficiently clear. In addition, documented IANA considerations
   are sometimes found to be too stringent to allow even working group
   documents (for which there is strong consensus) to perform a registration
   in advance of actual RFC publication.
      </t>
      <t>
   In order to allow assignments in such cases, the IESG is granted authority
   to override registration procedures and approve assignments on a
   case-by-case basis.
      </t>
      <t>
   The intention here is not to overrule properly documented procedures, or to
   obviate the need for protocols to properly document their IANA
   considerations. Rather, it is to permit assignments in specific cases where
   it is obvious that the assignment should just be made, but updating the
   IANA process beforehand is too onerous.
        </t>
        <t>
   When the IESG is required to take action as described in this section,

 The following are some defined policies, most of which are in use

 It should be noted that it often makes sense to partition a namespace
 into multiple categories, with assignments within each category
 handled differently.
 Many protocols now partition
 namespaces into two or more parts, with one range reserved
 for Private or Experimental Use while other ranges are reserved for
 globally unique assignments assigned following some review process.
 Dividing a namespace into ranges makes it possible to have different
 policies in place for different ranges and different use cases.
      </t>
      <t>
        Similarly, it will often be useful to specify multiple policies in parallel,
        with each policy being used under different circumstances.

          New assignments may be approved by the IESG.
          Although there is no requirement that the request be
          documented in an RFC, the IESG has discretion to request
          documents or other supporting materials on a case-by-case
          basis.
        </t>
        <t>
          IESG Approval is not intended to be used often or as a
          "common case"; indeed, it has seldom been used in practice
          during the period RFC 2434 was in effect.  Rather, it is
          intended to be available in conjunction with other policies
          as a fall-back mechanism in the case where one of the other
          allowable approval mechanisms cannot be employed in a timely
          fashion or for some other compelling reason.  IESG Approval
          is not intended to circumvent the public review processes
          implied by other policies that could have been employed for
          a particular assignment.  IESG Approval would be
          appropriate, however, in cases where expediency is desired
          and there is strong consensus (such as from a working group)
          for making the assignment.
        </t>
        <t>
          The following guidelines are suggested for any evaluation
          under IESG Approval:
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>
            The IESG can (and should) reject a request if another path

            there is no compelling reason not to use that path.
              </t>
              <t>
            Before approving a request, the community should be

            information as is reasonably possible about the request.

      <section anchor="experts-motivation" title="The Motivation for Designated Experts">
        <t>
   IANA does not define registry policy itself; rather, it carries out
   policies that have been defined by others and published in RFCs. As part of
   that process, review of proposed registrations is often appropriate.
        </t>
        <t>
   The preferred way of ensuring such review is for a proposed registration to
   be published as an RFC, as this ensures that the specification is publicly
   and permanently available. It is particularly important if any potential
   interoperability issues might arise. For example, some assignments are not
   just assignments, but also involve an element of protocol specification. A
   new option may define fields that need to be parsed and acted on, which (if
   specified poorly) may not fit cleanly with the architecture of other
   options or the base protocols on which they are built.
        </t>
        <t>
   In some cases, however, the burden of publishing an RFC in order to
   register a protocol element is excessive.
        </t>
        <t>
   However, it is generally still useful (and sometimes necessary) to discuss
   proposed registrations within the community, on a mailing list. Such a
   mailing list provides opportunity for public review prior to assignment,
   and allows for a consultative process when registrants want help in
   understanding what a proper registration should contain.
        </t>
        <t>
   While discussion on a mailing list can provide valuable technical
   feedback, opinions may vary and discussions may continue for some
   time without clear resolution.  In addition, IANA cannot participate
   in all of these mailing lists and cannot determine if or when such
   discussions reach consensus.  Therefore, IANA relies on a "designated
   expert" for advice regarding the specific question of whether an
   assignment should be made.  The designated expert is an individual
   who is responsible for carrying out an appropriate evaluation and
   returning a recommendation to IANA.
        </t>
        <t>
   It should be noted that a key motivation for having designated
   experts is for the IETF to provide IANA with a subject matter expert
   to whom the evaluation process can be delegated.  IANA forwards
   requests for an assignment to the expert for evaluation, and the
   expert (after performing the evaluation) informs IANA as to whether
   or not to make the assignment or registration.
        </t>
        <t>
          It will often be useful to use a designated expert only some of the time,
          as a supplement to other processes.  For more discussion of that topic,
          see <xref target="multiple-policies"/>.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="experts-role" title="The Role of the Designated Expert">
        <t>
   The designated expert is responsible for initiating and coordinating
   the appropriate review of an assignment request.  The review may be
   wide or narrow, depending on the situation and the judgment of the
   designated expert.  This may involve consultation with a set of
   technology experts, discussion on a public mailing list, consultation
   with a working group (or its mailing list if the working group has
   disbanded), etc.  Ideally, the designated expert follows specific
   review criteria as documented with the protocol that creates or uses
   the namespace.  See the IANA Considerations sections of <xref target="RFC3748"/>
   and <xref target="RFC3575"/> for specific examples.
        </t>
        <t>
   Designated experts are expected to be able to defend their decisions
   to the IETF community, and the evaluation process is not intended to
   be secretive or bestow unquestioned power on the expert.  Experts are
   expected to apply applicable documented review or vetting procedures,
   or in the absence of documented criteria, follow generally accepted
   norms such as those in <xref target="expert-reviews"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
   <xref target="updating-registrations"/> discusses disputes and appeals in more detail.
        </t>
        <t>
   Designated experts are appointed by the IESG (normally upon
   recommendation by the relevant Area Director).  They are typically
   named at the time a document creating or updating a namespace is
   approved by the IESG, but as experts originally appointed may later
   become unavailable, the IESG will appoint replacements if necessary.
        </t>
        <t>
   For some registries, it has proven useful to have multiple designated
   experts.  Sometimes those experts work together in evaluating a
   request, while in other cases additional experts serve as backups.
   In cases of disagreement among those experts, it is the
   responsibility of those experts to make a single clear recommendation
   to IANA.  It is not appropriate for IANA to resolve disputes among
   experts.  In extreme situations, such as deadlock, the IESG may need
   to step in to resolve the problem.
        </t>
        <t>
   In registries where a pool of experts evaluates requests, the pool
   should have a single chair responsible for defining how requests are
   to be assigned to and reviewed by experts.  In some cases, the expert
   pool may consist of a primary and backups, with the backups involved
   only when the primary expert is unavailable.  In other cases, IANA
   might assign requests to individual members in sequential or
   approximate random order.  In the event that IANA finds itself having
   received conflicting advice from its experts, it is the
   responsibility of the pool's chair to resolve the issue and provide
   IANA with clear instructions.
        </t>
        <t>
   Since the designated experts are appointed by the IESG, they may be
   removed by the IESG.

      <section anchor="expert-reviews" title="Designated Expert Reviews">
        <t>
   In the years since RFC 2434 was published and has been put to
   use, experience has led to the following observations:

          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
        A designated expert must respond in a timely fashion, normally
        within a week for simple requests to a few weeks for more
        complex ones.  Unreasonable delays can cause significant
        problems for those needing assignments, such as when products
        need code points to ship.  This is not to say that all reviews
        can be completed under a firm deadline, but they must be
        started, and the requester and IANA should have some
        transparency into the process if an answer cannot be given
        quickly.
            </t>
            <t>
        If a designated expert does not respond to IANA's requests
        within a reasonable period of time, either with a response or
        with a reasonable explanation for the delay (some requests
        may be particularly complex), and if this is a recurring event,
        IANA must raise the issue with the IESG.  Because of the
        problems caused by delayed evaluations and assignments, the IESG
        should take appropriate actions to ensure that the expert
        understands and accepts his or her responsibilities, or appoint
        a new expert.
            </t>
            <t>
        The designated expert is not required to personally bear the
        burden of evaluating and deciding all requests, but acts as a
        shepherd for the request, enlisting the help of others as
        appropriate.  In the case that a request is denied, and
        rejecting the request is likely to be controversial, the expert
        should have the support of other subject matter experts.  That
        is, the expert must be able to defend a decision to the
        community as a whole.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
   When a designated expert is used, the documentation should give
   clear guidance to the designated expert, laying out criteria for
   performing an evaluation and reasons for rejecting a request.
   In the case where there are no specific documented criteria, the
   presumption should be that a code point should be granted unless
   there is a compelling reason to the contrary.  Possible reasons to
   deny a request include these:

          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
        Scarcity of code points, where the finite remaining code points
        should be prudently managed, or when a request for a large
        number of code points is made, when a single code point is the
        norm.
            </t>
            <t>
        Documentation is not of sufficient clarity to evaluate or ensure
        interoperability.
            </t>
            <t>
        The code point is needed for a protocol extension, but the
        extension is not consistent with the documented (or generally
        understood) architecture of the base protocol being extended,
        and would be harmful to the protocol if widely deployed.  It is
        not the intent that "inconsistencies" refer to minor differences
        "of a personal preference nature".  Instead, they refer to
        significant differences such as inconsistencies with the
        underlying security model, implying a change to the semantics of
        an existing message type or operation, requiring unwarranted
        changes in deployed systems (compared with alternate ways of
        achieving a similar result), etc.
            </t>
            <t>
        The extension would cause problems with existing deployed
        systems.
            </t>
            <t>
        The extension would conflict with one under active development
        by the IETF, and having both would harm rather than foster
        interoperability.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
         <t>
         When a designated expert is used, documents MUST NOT name the
         designated expert in the document itself; instead, any suggested
         names should be relayed to the appropriate Area Director at the time
         the document is sent to the IESG for approval. This is usually done
         in the document shepherd writeup.
      </t>
      <t>
        If the request should also be reviewed on a specific public mailing
         list, its address should be specified.
      </t>

      <section anchor="expert-lifecycle" title="Expert Reviews and the Document Lifecycle">
        <t>
          Review by the designated expert is necessarily done at a particular point in time,
          and represents review of a particular version of the document.
          Deciding when the review should take place is a question of good judgment.
          And while re-reviews might be done when it's acknowledged that the documentation
          of the registered item has changed substantially, making sure that re-review
          happens requires attention and care.
        </t>
        <t>
          It is possible, through carelessness, accident, inattentiveness, or even
          willful disregard, that changes might be made after the designated expert's
          review and approval that would, if the document were re-reviewed, cause the expert
          not to approve the registration.  It is up to the IESG, with the token held by
          the responsible Area Director, to be alert to such situations and to
          recognize that such changes need to be checked.

    <section anchor="referring" title="Documentation References in IANA Registries">
      <t>
        Usually, registries and registry entries include references to documentation (RFCs
        or other documents).  The purpose of these references is to provide pointers for
        implementors to find details necessary for implementation, NOT to simply note what
        document created the registry or entry.  Therefore:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            If a document registers an item that is defined and explained elsewhere, the
            registered reference should be to that document, and not to the document that
            is merely performing the registration.
          </t>
          <t>
            If the registered item is defined and explained in the current document,
            it is important to include sufficient information to enable implementors to
            understand the item and to create a proper implementation.
          </t>
          <t>
            If the registered item is explained primarily in a specific section of the
            reference document, it is useful to include a section reference.
            For example, "[RFC9876], Section 3.2", rather than just "[RFC9876]".
          </t>
          <t>
            For documentation of a new registry, the reference should provide information
            about the registry itself, not just a pointer to the creation of it.
            Useful information includes the purpose of the registry, a rationale for its
            creation, documentation of the process and policy for new registrations,
            guidelines for new registrants or designated experts, and other such
            related information.

    <section anchor="bis-docs" title='What to Do in "bis" Documents'>
      <t>
        On occaison, an RFC is issued that obsoletes a previous edition of the
        same document. We sometimes call these "bis" documents, such as when
        RFC 9876 is updated by draft-ietf-foo-rfc9876bis. When the original
        document created registries and/or registered entries, there is a
        question of how to handle the IANA Considerations section in the "bis"
        document.
      </t>
      <t>
        If the registrations specify the original document as a reference,
        those registrations should be updated to point to the current (not
        obsolete) documentation for those items. Usually, that will mean
        changing the reference to be the "bis" document.
      </t>
      <t>
        For example, suppose RFC 9876 registered the "BANANA" flag in the
        "Fruit Access Flags" registry, and the documentation for that flag is
        in Section 3.2.
        
        <figure>
          <preamble>The current registry might look, in part, like this:</preamble>
          <artwork>
   Name      Description          Reference
   --------  -------------------  ---------
   BANANA    Flag for bananas     [RFC9876], Section 3.2
          </artwork>
        </figure>
        If draft-ietf-foo-rfc9876bis obsoletes RFC 9876 and, because of some
        rearrangement, now documents the flag in Section 4.1.2, the IANA
        Considerations of the bis document might contain text such as this:
        <vspace blankLines="1"/>
        <list style="empty"><t>
        IANA is asked to change the registration information for the BANANA flag
        in the "Fruit Access Flags" registry to the following:
        <figure>
          <artwork>
   Name      Description          Reference
   --------  -------------------  ---------
   BANANA    Flag for bananas     [[this RFC]], Section 4.2.1
          </artwork>
        </figure>
        </t></list>
      </t>
      <t>
        In many cases, if there are a number of registered references to the
        original RFC and the document organization has not changed the
        registered section numbering much, it may simply be reasonable to do
        this:
        <list style="empty"><t>
        Because this document obsoletes RFC 9876,
        IANA is asked to change all registration information that references
        [RFC9876] to instead reference [[this RFC]].
        </t></list>
      </t>
      <t>
        If information for registered items has been or is being moved to
        other documents, then, of course, the registration information should
        be changed to point to those other documents. In no case is it
        reasonable to leave documentation pointers to the obsoleted document
        for any registries or registered items that are still in current use.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="misc" title="Miscellaneous Issues">
      <section anchor="misc-no-actions" title="When There Are No IANA Actions">
        <t>
   Before an Internet-Draft can be published as an RFC, IANA needs to
   know what actions (if any) it needs to perform.  Experience has shown
   that it is not always immediately obvious whether a document has no
   IANA actions, without reviewing the document in some detail.  In
   order to make it clear to IANA that it has no actions to perform (and
   that the author has consciously made such a determination), such
   documents should include an IANA Considerations section that states:
          <list>
            <t>
      This document has no IANA actions.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
   This statement, or an equivalent, must only be inserted after the working group
   or individual submitter has carefully verified it to be true.  Using
   such wording as a matter of "boilerplate" or without careful
   consideration can lead to incomplete or incorrect IANA actions being
   performed.
        </t>
        <t>
   If a specification makes use of values from a namespace that is not
   managed by IANA, it may be useful to note this fact, with
   wording such as this:
          <list>
            <t>
      The values of the Foobar parameter are assigned by the Barfoo
      registry on behalf of the Rabfoo Forum.  Therefore, this document
      has no IANA actions.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
   In some cases, the absence of IANA-assigned values may be considered
   valuable information for future readers; in other cases, it may be
   considered of no value once the document has been approved, and may

      <section anchor="lacking-guidance" title="Namespaces Lacking Documented Guidance">
        <t>
   For all existing RFCs that either explicitly or implicitly rely on
   IANA to evaluate assignments without specifying a precise evaluation
   policy, IANA (in consultation with the IESG) will continue to decide
   what policy is appropriate.  Changes to existing policies can always
   be initiated through the normal IETF consensus process.
        </t>
        <t>
   All future RFCs that either explicitly or implicitly rely on IANA to
   register or otherwise manage namespace assignments MUST provide
   guidelines for managing the namespace.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="after-fact" title="After-the-Fact Registrations">
        <t>
   Occasionally, IANA becomes aware that an unassigned value from a
   managed namespace is in use on the Internet or that an assigned value
   is being used for a different purpose than originally registered.
   IANA will not condone such misuse; procedures of the type
   described in this document MUST be applied to such cases.
   In the absence of specifications to the contrary, values may only be
   reassigned for a different purpose with the consent of the original
   assignee (when possible) and with due consideration of the impact of
   such a reassignment.  In cases of likely controversy, consultation
   with the IESG is advised.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="reclaiming" title="Reclaiming Assigned Values">
        <t>
   Reclaiming previously assigned values for reuse is tricky, because
   doing so can lead to interoperability problems with deployed systems
   still using the assigned values.  Moreover, it can be extremely
   difficult to determine the extent of deployment of systems making use
   of a particular value.  However, in cases where the namespace is
   running out of unassigned values and additional ones are needed, it
   may be desirable to attempt to reclaim unused values.  When
   reclaiming unused values, the following (at a minimum) should be
   considered:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
        Attempts should be made to contact the original party to which a
        value is assigned, to determine if the value was ever used, and
        if so, the extent of deployment.  (In some cases, products were
        never shipped or have long ceased being used.  In other cases,
        it may be known that a value was never actually used at all.)
            </t>
            <t>
        Reassignments should not normally be made without the
        concurrence of the original requester.  Reclamation under such
        conditions should only take place where there is strong evidence
        that a value is not widely used, and the need to reclaim the
        value outweighs the cost of a hostile reclamation.  In any case,
        IESG Approval is needed in this case.
            </t>
            <t>
        It may be appropriate to write up the proposed action and
        solicit comments from relevant user communities.  In some cases,
        it may be appropriate to write an RFC that goes through a formal
        IETF process (including IETF Last Call) as was done when DHCP
        reclaimed some of its "Private Use" options <xref target="RFC3942"/>.
            </t>

      <section anchor="assignee" title="Contact Person vs Assignee or Owner">
        <t>
          Many registries include designation of a technical or administrative contact
          associated with each entry.  Often, this is recorded as contact information for
          an individual.  It is unclear, though, what role the individual has with respect
          to the registration: is this item registered on behalf of the individual,
          the company the individual worked for, or perhaps another organization the
          individual was acting for?
        </t>
        <t>
          This matters because some time later, when the individual has changed jobs or roles,
          and perhaps can no longer be contacted, someone might want to update the registration.
          IANA has no way to know what company, organization, or individual should be allowed
          to take the registration over.  For registrations rooted in RFCs, the stream owner
          (such as the IESG or the IAB) can make an overriding decision.  But in other cases,
          there is no recourse.
        </t>
        <t>
          Registries can include, in addition to a "Contact" field, an "Assignee"
          or "Owner" field that can be used to address this situation,
          giving IANA clear guidance as to the actual owner of the registration.
          Alternatively, organizations can put an organizational role into the "Contact"
          field in order to make their ownership clear.

   Appeals of registration decisions made by IANA can be made using the
   normal IETF appeals process as described in Section 6.5 of

   IESG, followed (if necessary) by an appeal to the IAB, etc.

   All IETF mailing lists associated with evaluating or discussing

   currently defined by Best Current Practices or by IESG decision.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
   Information that creates or updates a registration needs to be
   authenticated and authorized.  IANA updates registries according to
   instructions in published RFCs and from the IESG.  It also may accept
   clarifications from document authors, relevant working group chairs, Designated
   Experts, and mail list participants, too.
      </t>
      <t>
   Information concerning possible security vulnerabilities of a
   protocol may change over time.  Likewise, security vulnerabilities
   related to how an assigned number is used may change as well.
   As new vulnerabilities are discovered,
   information about such vulnerabilities may need to be attached to
   existing registrations, so that users are not misled as to the true
   security issues surrounding the use of a registered number.
      </t>
      <t>
   An analysis of security issues is generally required for all
   protocols that make use of parameters (data types, operation codes,
   keywords, etc.) used in IETF protocols or registered by IANA.  Such
   security considerations are usually included in the protocol document
   <xref target="RFC3552"/>.  It is the responsibility of the IANA considerations
   associated with a particular registry to specify what (if any)
   security considerations must be provided when assigning new values,
   and the process for reviewing such claims.

Just was speaking with someone at the IANA office hours.

      <t>
   Changes include:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
        Major reordering of text to expand descriptions and to better
        group topics such as "updating registries" vs. "creating new
        registries", in order to make it easier for authors to find the
        text most applicable to their needs.
          </t>
          <t>
        Numerous editorial changes to improve readability.
          </t>
          <t>
        Changed the term "IETF Consensus" to "IETF Review" and added
        more clarifications.  History has shown that people see the
        words "IETF Consensus" (without consulting the actual
        definition) and are quick to make incorrect assumptions about
        what the term means in the context of IANA Considerations.
          </t>
          <t>
        Added "RFC Required" to list of defined policies.
          </t>
          <t>
        Much more explicit directions and examples of "what to put in
        RFCs".
          </t>
          <t>
        "Specification Required" now implies use of a Designated Expert
        to evaluate specs for sufficient clarity.
          </t>
          <t>
        Significantly changed the wording in the Designated Experts section.
        Main purpose is to make clear that Expert Reviewers are accountable to the
        community, and to provide some guidance for review criteria in
        the default case.
          </t>
          <t>
        Changed wording to remove any special appeals path.  The normal
        RFC 2026 appeals path is used.
          </t>
          <t>
        Added a section about reclaiming unused value.
          </t>
          <t>
        Added a section on after-the-fact registrations.
          </t>
